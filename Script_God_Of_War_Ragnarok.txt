33;3;Atreus;Male;I'm sorry I couldn't take the shot.
34;3;Kratos;Male;I did not wish you to.
35;3;Atreus;Male;I keep hoping she'll let it go. You saved her life!
36;3;Kratos;Male;I killed her son there is no letting that go
37;3;Atreus;Male;Yeah… I guess killing Baldur really did bring on Fimbulwinter. It never stopped snowing after that day… think it's ever gonna get better?
38;3;Kratos;Male;Someday. But the worst is still ahead of us. We must be strong.
39;3;Atreus;Male;I got it.
40;3;Kratos;Male;I will get the deer…
41;3;Atreus;Male;Go on, girls.
42;4;Atreus;Male;It's okay, boy. You're okay I know. I missed you too. Where's your food? Still hungry? Come on boy. You need to eat. Eat. What? too big? There you go. Good boy.
43;4;Kratos;Male;Atreus.. The time draws near. You must prepare yourself.
44;4;Atreus;Male;For what? he's still eating. he wants to live.
45;4;Kratos;Male;He is dying.
46;4;Atreus;Male;You're a good boy... a brave boy. Fast and strong.. But you can rest now. Okay? I'll be okay… You can let go now. You have to let go. Sofna… upp frá pessu.. Sofna hedan.. Sofna… sofna… sofna
47;4;Kratos;Male;Come. We train.
48;4;Atreus;Male;What? No. it's the middle of the night.
49;4;Kratos;Male;Night does not stop our enemies.
50;4;Atreus;Male;Why? What for? Training is all we ever do. Ever! It's not enough. We can't hide forever.
51;4;Kratos;Male;We do not hide.. We prepare for a fight for which we are not ready. Now go.
52;4;Atreus;Male;Time is running out. The prophecy say Fimbulwinter leads to Ragnarok. War is coming. Whatever Loki's supposed to be doing he's supposed to be doing it now. My story doesn't end hiding in these woods. I should be out there finding out who I am.. who Loki is.
53;4;Kratos;Male;I will not allow you to pick a fight with gods.
54;4;Atreus;Male;I don't want to fight anyone. I just want answers.
55;4;Kratos;Male;And if those answers lead to war with Asgard?
56;4;Atreus;Male;maybe that's what mother wanted…
57;4;Kratos;Male;We do not know what Mother wanted.
58;4;Atreus;Male;Looks like we never will. Look, can I have a moment alone with Fenrir before I bury him?
59;5;Mimir;Male;Well, I'd recognize that dour expression anywhere. Care to tell me what went wrong?
60;5;Kratos;Male;The wolf is gone.
61;5;Mimir;Male;Aw, no not Fenrir… How's the lad taking it?
62;5;Kratos;Male;Not well. He goes to bury him.
63;5;Mimir;Male;Ah, damn it All right brother good night then.
64;6;Faye;Female;Kratos? Are you joining me?
65;6;Kratos;Male;Faye?
66;6;Faye;Female;Are you ready? You walk as though Ymir himself sits atop your shoulders
67;6;Kratos;Male;This is your hunt. I will follow.
68;6;Faye;Female;Very well, Grumbles A fresh kill.. At least it didn't suffer. Am I to decipher your grunting? Tell me your thoughts.
69;6;Kratos;Male;We hunt a predator.
70;6;Faye;Female;A wolf, yes.
71;6;Kratos;Male;Predators kill. It is the natural order of things.
72;6;Faye;Female;Your words are misguided. Approach slowly. It's okay little one. We want to help. Don't we? No no. Don't. Come on. The sick wolf we found beyond our stave. He found his way inside as I said he would. We should have acted.
73;6;Kratos;Male;It was not our concern. Now it is.
74;6;Faye;Female;A problem doesn't have to reach our doorstep for it to be our responsibility. If we have the power to limit the harm it could cause, we should act. Who are we to hide and do nothing?
75;6;Kratos;Male;We are not hiding.
76;6;Faye;Female;Gonna make me pick that one up? Good boy. This way.
77;6;Kratos;Male;Faye! Faye? Faye! Faye!
78;6;Faye;Female;Time is running out, my love. And there is much to do.
79;7;Mimir;Male;Brother! Brother! Brother?
80;7;Kratos;Male;Where is Atreus?
81;7;Mimir;Male;Hence my bellowing.He never came back from burying the wolf. It's been some time…
82;7;Kratos;Male;He cannot be far.
83;7;Mimir;Male;Use your words brother.
84;7;Kratos;Male;The tracks stop here…
85;7;Mimir;Male;and we're not alone.
86;7;Kratos;Male;A bear… mauled.
87;7;Mimir;Male;By what?
88;7;Kratos;Male;A larger bear. Wounded. The fight destroyed the tree. We must find Atreus.
89;8;Kratos;Male;Atreus! Where are you? Atreus? Atreus! Atreus! Atreus… Atreus…
90;8;Atreus;Male;What…?
91;8;Kratos;Male;First, focus. Heal.
92;8;Atreus;Male;What happened?
93;8;Kratos;Male;You do not remember?
94;8;Atreus;Male;I buried Fenrir. and then.. I'm, I'm not sure. I was so sad and then I was angry. Then scared. I remember… running. There was a bear. Charging and I charged back? But that had to be a dream…
95;8;Kratos;Male;Your emotions… they transformed you.
96;8;Atreus;Male;I I didn't know I could do that.
97;8;Kratos;Male;You did not do anything… They overcame you. This is why we must not abandon your training. We do not know the reach of your abilities. They will be dangerous without discipline to control them.
98;8;Atreus;Male;You've already taught me discipline. I need more than that. I need answers. Answers you don't have.
99;8;Kratos;Male;Answers only your mother had. Answers she withheld.
100;8;Atreus;Male;What if there was someone who could help us? Someone that could give us answers about the Giants and who Loki's supposed to be…
101;8;Kratos;Male;Atreus…
102;8;Atreus;Male;Wouldn't that help to understand what I'm becoming? latreyas listen to m
103;8;Kratos;Male;Atreus! Listen to me. I might have killed you. Until you learn control, we will take more unnecessary risks.
104;8;Atreus;Male;Inaction is also a risk. You taught me that. Stop thinking like a father for a moment and start thinking like a General.
105;8;Kratos;Male;NO! No. Collect yourself. This one.
106;8;Atreus;Male;Ásjá. I didn't mean to...
107;8;Kratos;Male;Intent does not matter. Only consequences.
108;8;Atreus;Male;What.. what can we do?nothin
109;8;Kratos;Male;Nothing. Nature will take its course.
110;9;Mimir;Male;As evening's go, that was entirely too eventful. Though I admit it was a bit like all times there, for a moment. The three of us navigating some hitherto-unhappened-upon patch of forest.. Been a while since you've joined us, if that's what you mean. Oh, well.. just tired, I suppose. You've seen one deer hunt you've seen them all.
111;9;Atreus;Male;How can you feel tired when you never sleep?
112;9;Mimir;Male;Now have a proper rest, my brothers. Things are always brighter in the morning.
113;10;Atreus;Male;What was that?!
114;10;Kratos;Male;Your bow! WHO ARE YOU?
115;10;Thor;Male;Can I come in? I have mead.
116;10;Kratos;Male;You would not find me good company.
117;10;Thor;Male;Oh. I'm sure we'll find lots to talk about. Nice place. You could have told me before I poured.
118;10;Kratos;Male;Why are you here?
119;10;Thor;Male;Just uh, being polite. You seem like a calm and reasonable person. Are you... a calm and reasonable person?
120;10;Kratos;Male;If the moment calls for a calm.
121;10;Thor;Male;I'd say the moment calls for calm, yeah.
122;11;Odin;Male;You know who I am. Back before winter set in, there were some misunderstandings.. incredible ones. But I think we all have a better idea of who we're dealing with. Now, what you did to his boys ..self-defense. Dying is what we Aesir live for. And let's be honest they were kind of useless but Baldur he had value. He was my best tracker. My closer. yeah his mind was gone sure but he had his uses and now he's gone because of you you follow me you have a debt you're no fun anymore
123;11;Kratos;Male;what do you want
124;11;Odin;Male;how about peace how does peace strike the esteemed retired God of War how about we just don't kill each other how about you stay home kick up your feet seek no quarrel with me and I'll have none with you of course it means that that one that one has to stop his search for tear
125;11;Kratos;Male;yeah we know what you've been up to stop it
126;11;Odin;Male;Tyr's old ways are dead he is dead you understand and then that's it then we are square. Shit I'll even sweeten the deal I'll let you keep the prisoner that I know you stole that's right I know you're in here somewhere your silver tongue little shit
127;11;Mimir;Male;why should we believe a word out of you What have your promises ever been worth?
128;11;Odin;Male;there he is my old partner in crime
129;11;Thor;Male;he's lost weight
130;11;Mimir;Male;if he tells you snow is white he's lying
131;11;Odin;Male;what kind of wisdom is that can't the smartest head alive see past himself see that we all want the same thing all right here's the deal I know you can trust I'll settle your debt with my ex keep Freya off your back keep your boy safe that's really all you want isn't it so what do you say
132;11;Kratos;Male;no
133;11;Odin;Male;don't take all day
134;11;Thor;Male;about time
135;12;Thor;Male;I've been waiting for this you're not from here we got a tradition called blood payments it means I get a piece of you for what you took from my family you'll pick it up You spiton my sons memories. I can't believe they lost to you.
136;12;Kratos;Male;You know my past?
137;12;Thor;Male;The "Ghost of Sparta"thing? Yeah.
138;12;Kratos;Male;Then you know what I am capable of.
139;12;Thor;Male;Show me. That is for Magni. sorry about your statute Tyr you preachy old stiff Was it luck? Did my sons die to blind, fucking luck? Dumbass You think you can come here, become a daddy, get a clean slate? That ain't how it works, you are a destroyer like me oh no I say when we're done I'm not leaving till I see the real you get up This is for Modi!
140;12;Kratos;Male;you put him last even in death
141;12;Thor;Male;the fuck you say
142;12;Kratos;Male;Modi sought us in fear of you he died of the woods you gave him
143;12;Thor;Male;oh we got a model Father here this feels familiar This is the God that murdered a pantheon because they hurt this feelings? Clever clever won't beat me I see why my sons fell to you even missed this lesser version of you but I am not my sons and your boy All-father has plans for him there he is there's the God of War considering your blood debt paid. Be seeing ya.
144;13;Brok;Male;told you he'd make it
145;13;Sindri;Male;Kratos it's syndrome that was quite a fight can we
146;13;Kratos;Male;Home now Odin is with atreus
147;13;Sindri;Male;oh no
148;13;Brok;Male;hey one last thing there tiny if you got Aesir at your door then I reckon your protection stave's busted once you chase Odin off you got another place to lay your head tonight and I don't mean that talking fella fella
149;13;Kratos;Male;I will not abandon my home
150;13;Brok;Male;oh yeah and wants to stop the All-Fucker from spying on you or raven-pecking your house to splinters while you're asleep in it nothing that's what you go get your boy and I'll speak to a certain someone about putting you up in his place in a pinch
151;14;Mimir;Male;Brother!
152;14;Atreus;Male;I was about to look for you
153;14;Kratos;Male;Are you hurt?
154;14;Atreus;Male;are you
155;14;Kratos;Male;what does he want
156;14;Atreus;Male;to uh pay for the roof and he invited me to Asgard
157;14;Mimir;Male;Did he? I couldn't hear once he went outside
158;14;Atreus;Male;I told him no obviously
159;14;Kratos;Male;good why were you searching for Tyr?
160;14;Atreus;Male;if I had told you I was looking for him you would have said not to
161;14;Kratos;Male;so you hid the truth for me
162;14;Atreus;Male;I wanted to tell you I really did but now that you know there's something you should see
163;14;Kratos;Male;No
164;14;Atreus;Male;Just trust me you want to
165;14;Kratos;Male;Trust?  you have broken my trust
166;14;Atreus;Male;then let me regain it let me show you what I found besides we haven't seen the last of Odin or Thor and clearly they can just walk in and blast holes in our home whenever they want there's only one way to get them off our backs And I think I know how sir
167;14;Kratos;Male;show me gather your things
168;15;Kratos;Male;are you ready go
169;15;Mimir;Male;and keep that change you bastard
170;15;Atreus;Male;you watching
171;15;Mimir;Male;well that's new
172;15;Atreus;Male;come on
173;15;Kratos;Male;Atreus wait
174;15;Mimir;Male;yeah I don't think he's waiting what is this lad? where are we?
175;15;Atreus;Male;Somewhere Only Giants were meant to see these shrines tell their stories to the world but it turns out the real stories the secret stories those they kept here inside you remember the story of Skoll and Hati the Wolf-Giants Odin captured them because he thinks it'll help him control when Ragnarok starts
176;15;Kratos;Male;I remember
177;15;Atreus;Male;but that's not the whole story see this shows the giant setting Skoll and Hati free
178;15;Mimir;Male;they are fre is this the past or the future?
179;15;Atreus;Male;depends when you're looking at it
180;15;Mimir;Male;spoken like a giant
181;15;Atreus;Male;see the wolves are safe somewhere in Vanaheim
182;15;Mimir;Male;it's not the first place Odin would look I suppose
183;15;Atreus;Male;there they are chasing the sun and moon
184;15;Mimir;Male;old habits
185;15;Atreus;Male;until look the moon gets stolen somehow
186;15;Kratos;Male;Atreus
187;15;Atreus;Male;see Hati's got nothing to chase
188;15;Mimir;Male;and they say celestial theft is a victimless crime
189;15;Atreus;Male;not totally sure who this is but someone comes along and rescues the moon then the moon blocks out the sun
190;15;Mimir;Male;a total eclipse I haven't seen one of those in a hundred winters
191;15;Atreus;Male;but then they chase an arrow and things go back to normal
192;15;Kratos;Male;what does any of this have to do with
193;15;Atreus;Male;we are coming to that look here's Ragnarok do you see who's leading the armies against Odin that's a Tyr! if he's gonna be around at Ragnarok that means he's got to be alive right
194;15;Kratos;Male;Mimir can this be?
195;15;Mimir;Male;Odin told me he killed Tyr and he trusted me at the time or so I thought
196;15;Atreus;Male;what if he didn't kill him what if he's just hadn't locked up some more all this time
197;15;Kratos;Male;we are back to "ifs", enough
198;15;Atreus;Male;wait
199;15;Kratos;Male;we are going home
200;15;Atreus;Male;wait I have one more thing to show you it's just out here
201;16;Kratos;Male;what is this
202;16;Atreus;Male;everything I found well almost everything
203;16;Mimir;Male;fast Giant craftsmanship you've been to Jotunheim again?
204;16;Atreus;Male;no I found it in one of the other shrines
205;16;Kratos;Male;"Other shrines"? how many have you visited
206;16;Atreus;Male;I well all of them all the ones I could still get to in Midgard anyway I don't know what it is but it's important just like all this when I was inside one of the shrines I saw an image of Tyr imprisoned but I couldn't tell where there are hints inside the other shrines you mentioned black smoke and the bleeding Earth but we can never figure out exactly
207;16;Kratos;Male;We
208;16;Atreus;Male;yeah Sindri's been helping me look I talked him into it it wasn't his idea I just needed someone to watch my back
209;16;Kratos;Male;black smoke beating earth could the prison be in Muspelheim?
210;16;Mimir;Male;unlikely Odin's got no presence to speak of in the primordial realms but the bleeding earth sounds like a mine aye?
211;16;Kratos;Male;the realm of the Dwarves perhaps
212;16;Mimir;Male;Svartalfheim, that's a good bet. Their mines did belch black smoke. and Odin's had his thumb on the Dwarves for a very long time
213;16;Atreus;Male;that's it then Tyr's in Svartalfheim somewhere imprisoned in a mine so what now
214;16;Kratos;Male;Home
215;17;Atreus;Male;Sindri!
216;17;Sindri;Male;As I live and breath is that Atreus it's been so long oh how you've grown
217;17;Atreus;Male;uh oh yeah
218;17;Sindri;Male;well if you'll follow me
219;17;Atreus;Male;where are we going this
220;17;Sindri;Male;the cleanest cabin in all the Nine Realms and I'd prefer it to stay that way not looking at anyone in particular Kratos
221;17;Kratos;Male;Hrmph
222;17;Sindri;Male;after that Thor incident we thought we should make up some rooms until you can figure out your next moves nearly there come in come in now if you would just wipe your feet very thoroughly I'll wait you're not gonna wipe your feet are you okay then your bedrooms are there the kitchen is just over there any anybody need a snack Kratos snack?
223;17;Kratos;Male;I do not need a snack
224;17;Atreus;Male;what we need is your help getting to Svartalfheim so we can try and rescue Tyr
225;17;Sindri;Male;T-Tyr? alive I mean that's what
226;17;Atreus;Male;it's okay I told him everything
227;17;Sindri;Male;Everything?
228;17;Kratos;Male;you aided my son disobeying me
229;17;Sindri;Male;no I I kept an eye on him on your behalf nothing risky everything very safe somebody else speak what's important
230;17;Atreus;Male;right now is that we try and open up travel between Realms again you said you know a way
231;17;Sindri;Male;yes I do I just it's just there's it's just a lot of mud
232;17;Mimir;Male;Then why haven't you opened the way already man
233;17;Sindri;Male;well to be frank there was something we needed your help with
234;17;Mimir;Male;Oh-ho! the Huldra Brothers finally require the services of the Smartest Man Alive
235;17;Sindri;Male;that's it precisely
236;18;Brok;Male;Hey! Not so fast! how'd that get in here What in the Hel is it anyway?
237;18;Kratos;Male;That is my son
238;18;Brok;Male;well what in all Jarnsmida happened to him? He's too damn tall now and he looks like that I blame you. Well come on then let's get him something that fits at least
239;18;Mimir;Male;he's just getting older you daft prat didn't you ever have an awkward phase in your youth
240;18;Atreus;Male;Hey
241;18;Brok;Male;I suppose what's done is done but you'll be putting your foot down from now on if you know what's good
242;18;Mimir;Male;oh he's trying believe me
243;18;Brok;Male;all right let's gear you fuckers up before you go off gallavanting
244;18;Kratos;Male;do you know this
245;18;Brok;Male;Hmm. busted up good wouldn't you rather I just whip you up a new one
246;18;Kratos;Male;It is  important to me
247;18;Brok;Male;well I'll see what I can do in the meanwhile how about I fix you up with something to get you by
248;19;Kratos;Male;how do we unlock the Realms
249;19;Sindri;Male;we'll just need something from back at the workshop follow me and be sure to bring the head
250;19;Mimir;Male;Hmph
251;19;Sindri;Male;so where exactly is Tyr being held
252;19;Atreus;Male;he is imprisoned in a mine somewhere that's all we know so far
253;20;Sindri;Male;We will just need the Bifrost and head. Brok do the touching
254;20;Mimir;Male;Ah, this would be the part requiring my assistance then
255;20;Sindri;Male;you said it this device here has been crafted to your measurements it'll help you get a better look at the problem with those Bifrost eyes of yours
256;20;Mimir;Male;so I do I control this thing somehow then
257;20;Sindri;Male;oh no no no no no no no no this is just to hold you in place while we shine this light in your eyes
258;20;Mimir;Male;Argh! Sindry you sodding bastard

272;21;Sindri;Male;now that we've reconfigured these gateways to use Yggdrasil Seeds you won't need a travel table or a Bifrost lamp anymore!
273;21;Kratos;Male;I also used it for light
274;21;Sindri;Male;okay good note I'll figure something out but first come on let me show you how it works This should take you to the wetlands outside Nidavellir City just make your way to the town square and ask for Durlin at the tavern
275;21;Atreus;Male;you sure they'll know him at the tavern
276;21;Sindri;Male;Durlin's always been an inveterate inebriate I suppose he might have completely changed but in my experience eh
277;21;Atreus;Male;did you want to come with us
278;21;Sindri;Male;oh I might drop in but the wetlands are moist and the Grim are everywhere hostile slimy foul-smelling creatures but good luck
279;21;Atreus;Male;thanks wait what
280;21;Sindri;Male;I said good luck
281;21;Atreus;Male;whoa. Do you feel that?
282;21;Mimir;Male;what's that lad
283;21;Atreus;Male;anything everything. It's warm!
284;22;Atreus;Male;I still can't believe Mom let a whole rebellion here against Odin and never talked about it
285;22;Mimir;Male;the fact that it didn't go well might have curbed that notion
286;22;Kratos;Male;what your mother did before we met was her business
287;22;Atreus;Male;did you ever ask
288;22;Kratos;Male;Eyes on the water there are resources
289;22;Atreus;Male;if you never ask mom about what she used to do what did you talk about when you met like did you just say woman guard the house I will go to catch fish in the river and then leave for five days
290;22;Kratos;Male;no your mother was far better at fishing than I
291;22;Atreus;Male;Uhhh, did you see that over there?
292;22;Kratos;Male;that wheel is blocking the channel
293;22;Mimir;Male;I imagine if you can turn it we should be able to get through
294;23;Atreus;Male;that earthquake earlier you think there will be another one
295;23;Mimir;Male;it's unlikely but geological disturbances tend to be unpredictable
296;23;Atreus;Male;If the geysers and smell here are worse because of Fimbulwinter maybe the earthquakes are too
297;23;Mimir;Male;Aye, you might be on to something lad
298;23;Kratos;Male;Atreus! look ahead
299;23;Atreus;Male;wow now this looks like a city
300;23;Mimir;Male;welcome to Nidavellir brothers
301;23;Atreus;Male;hey Dwarves oh they're uh running away
302;23;Kratos;Male;An alarm
303;23;Mimir;Male;I'd only sounded alarm like that if I still had my body and was fearing the notion of being detached from it
304;23;Atreus;Male;Why all that for us though
305;23;Kratos;Male;they are scared
306;23;Mimir;Male;Most definitely an alarm I'm afraid
307;23;Atreus;Male;why is everybody hiding
308;23;Kratos;Male;Stay alert
309;24;Kratos;Male;What is it Dwarf?
310;24;Sindri;Male;you know I'm glad I came back here at least once before Ragnarok oh if these cobblestones could talk then they'd have mouths filthy disgusting mouths do you mind if I fiddle with your bow Ucch, you're a long overdue for a replacement taking advantage of certain materials ow! structural sensitivity to Sonic vibrations has been something. Ugh! I've been meaning to try for quite some time now
311;24;Atreus;Male;thanks for uh finally trying it What's it gonna be this time
312;24;Sindri;Male;patience I find it's best to see these things oh in action ah Hooo! There. oh take aim at that gate there but before you loose say "skjalfa" Skjalfa!
313;25;Atreus;Male;I think that's him hello
314;25;Raeb;Male;watch yourselves apparently there are intruders about
315;25;Atreus;Male;Oh that's us I think
316;25;Raeb;Male;Eh well if you're planning on killing me at least let me finish this song that alarm was in just the perfect key
317;25;Atreus;Male;we're just looking for a friend of ours named Durlin.
318;25;Raeb;Male;well we both know that's not true Durlin's got no friends left but if that's all you need head out the back way there and you'll see the safety office just across the river just don't go making trouble for the rest of us and while you travel through this realm maybe you could clean up the heads mess
319;25;Kratos;Male;what mess
320;25;Mimir;Male;later brother
321;25;Kratos;Male;I wish to hear of this mess
322;25;Raeb;Male;the rigs in the bay why don't you ask the condescending skull
323;25;Mimir;Male;head I've got skin but he's right I made a mistake I'd have a shut them down
324;26;Sindri;Male;sorry one more thing although these are gifts I'm giving to you so I shouldn't be sorry and you should be thankful anyways here please be careful
325;26;Atreus;Male;it's beautiful thanks Sindri
326;26;Sindri;Male;it is beautiful isn't it it's also very useful you'll be able to find anything your heart desires with it
327;26;Atreus;Male;Really?
328;26;Sindri;Male;as long as your heart desires of location your father and you decide and plot to travel together then yes
329;26;Kratos;Male;it is a compass
330;26;Sindri;Male;ah but a beautiful compass now scamper off
331;27;Atreus;Male;we're looking for Durlin
332;27;Durlin;Male;you have an appointment
333;27;Atreus;Male;uh no has anyone ever had an appointment here
334;27;Durlin;Male;Here to collect on something pal? think parading a severed head around on your hip is going to scare me into somehow approving Estrid's accretion proposal eh?
335;27;Kratos;Male;we are looking for a prisoner of Odin's
336;27;Atreus;Male;he's being kept in a mine somewhere some friends of ours said that you could help
337;27;Durlin;Male;where did you get You chop her head off with that too eh?
338;27;Kratos;Male;she was my wife
339;27;Durlin;Male;Dínner and I wondered where she went after our little coup here failed.
340;27;Atreus;Male;failed?
341;27;Durlin;Male;Yeah, come come. Failed
342;27;Kratos;Male;Faye is dead
343;27;Durlin;Male;The best of them are ones left alive have to pay the price I am afraid I can't help you with your little prisoner situation
344;27;Atreus;Male;but he could have answers on how to stop Odin and free Svartalfheim from the Aesir
345;27;Durlin;Male;I'm not in the business of crossing the All-Father anymore. Wait! before you go Take this
346;27;Atreus;Male;what is it?
347;27;Durlin;Male;a fine hygiene code violation for improper transport of a rotting head. Two demerits for speaking the All-Father's given name and uh, yeah for fucking up my desk
348;27;Atreus;Male;A fine?
349;27;Durlin;Male;Pay it at your leisure okay? get out of my office
350;28;Mimir;Male;Heimdall there's a name I don't miss hearing
351;28;Kratos;Male;No one said it until you did just now
352;28;Mimir;Male;Durlin! He didn't need to say it, brother, it was written all over his face er well burned I should say. Into his head
353;28;Atreus;Male;He burned that into Durlin's head?
354;28;Mimir;Male;Failed rebellions tend to warrant swift and enduring retribution
355;28;Kratos;Male;He is a captain of Odin?
356;28;Mimir;Male;Aye and the bearer of Gjallarhorn A true believer that one There are a few things so dangeours in a man as lack of doubt
357;28;Atreus;Male;seems like we're here come on Whoa is that a dreki? what happened here

366;29;Kratos;Male;Gah!

400;32;Atreus;Male;Tyr listen I swear we're not here to hurt you we're just trying to get you out
401;32;Tyr;Male;Get away from me please, I beg you show mercy
402;32;Atreus;Male;Take you somewhere safe away from Odin this is my father we help people
403;32;Tyr;Male;I don't belong out here please it's worse when he's angry
404;32;Atreus;Male;Father!
405;32;Kratos;Male;Are you not a soldier? are you not a leader of men? Master yourself! my son brought us to this place for you look at him
406;32;Tyr;Male;you? Why? you don't know me
407;32;Atreus;Male;I know what you stood for you helped the Giants we're returning the favor
408;32;Tyr;Male;We?
409;32;Kratos;Male;we are leaving are you coming with us
410;32;Atreus;Male;here your statue in the lake you had a spear I thought you needed a
411;32;Tyr;Male;walking stick No. A kind thought but no thank you no
412;32;Atreus;Male;But. Okay
413;32;Tyr;Male;I I ran because I don't always know what's real Eh, sometimes there's a I, uh
414;32;Mimir;Male;There is no shame in that brother we live in strange times
415;32;Tyr;Male;everyone hears him talk
416;32;Kratos;Male;we must return home
417;33;Tyr;Male;before we go any further the truth what is it you want from me you speak of Ragnarok is it a God of War you came to find is that the Tyr you need
418;33;Kratos;Male;Atreus?
419;33;Atreus;Male;I…
420;33;Tyr;Male;Forgive me that I am grateful for my freedom but if you want me to follow you to war or worse yet lead you to it then kill me now my fight is gone damage is done
421;33;Mimir;Male;no one's killing you brother
422;33;Tyr;Male;Better that than to live to see Ragnarok
423;33;Kratos;Male;we do not seek war
424;33;Atreus;Male;we just want some answers
425;33;Tyr;Male;I don't know how to help you
426;33;Atreus;Male;it doesn't matter the Giants trusted you that's the Tyr we need we need you
427;33;Tyr;Male;alright all I ask is for a good night's rest and maybe some food I think you killed the guards bringing me dinner
428;33;Mimir;Male;brother perhaps now you'd like to finish the story
429;33;Kratos;Male;Hm. The sons of Thor attacked us we killed them. Baldur tried to kill Freya I killed him.
430;33;Atreus;Male;but you skipped over how he fought and freed the Valkyries and that the Giants are all gone and now they called me Loki and finding the shrines
431;33;Tyr;Male;The Giants are gone?
432;33;Atreus;Male;When we got to Jotunheim they were all dead.
433;33;Tyr;Male;Dead? do you think Odin?
434;33;Kratos;Male;we do not know
435;33;Mimir;Male;I think we're getting out of here not a moment too soon
436;33;Atreus;Male;Whoa what are those?
437;33;Tyr;Male;reinforcements from Asgard the Einherjar will want to investigate my disappearance thoroughly
438;33;Atreus;Male;are they using the sky to travel between Realms?
439;33;Mimir;Male;Odin's got tricks up his sleeve we have not dared to consider
440;33;Atreus;Male;they're coming down on Nidavellir too. will the Dwarves be okay?
441;33;Kratos;Male;the time for such concerns has passed we must leave now
442;34;Tyr;Male;Yggdrasil! it's been too long I've forgotten the beauty
443;34;Atreus;Male;Tyr in your travels did you ever hear the Giants talk about Loki?
444;34;Tyr;Male;I'm sorry that name doesn't sound familiar the Giants are were a very private people
445;34;Atreus;Male;makes sense perhaps after a rest
446;35;Atreus;Male;so can we talk about what to do next
447;35;Kratos;Male;there is much to consider we will speak in the morning
448;35;Atreus;Male;oh okay in the morning
449;35;Brok;Male;Hold still hold still YAA!
450;35;Tyr;Male;much better thank you
451;35;Atreus;Male;see sleep tight Tyr I'm going to turn in big day tomorrow
452;36;Sindri;Male;Know what? they must be in the pantry I'll just look quite
453;36;Mimir;Male;what are you thinking brother
454;36;Kratos;Male;I'm thinking I want things to be the way they were
455;36;Mimir;Male;well I'd like to climb a tree you again Certain ships have sailed
456;36;Kratos;Male;I just wish Atreus were not so restless I care only for his safety
457;36;Mimir;Male;I know brother but holding him too tight won't keep him out of danger the lad's determined to make a few mistakes of his own and I hate to say it but I think Tyr might be one of them I've never seen a man broken so completely
458;36;Kratos;Male;His pain is fresh You expect too much
459;36;Mimir;Male;Aye perhaps pity Freya still wants to kill you that's an ally we could use
460;36;Kratos;Male;that is not an option
461;36;Mimir;Male;No I don't suppose it is
462;37;Sindri;Male;trouble sleeping?
463;37;Atreus;Male;Aah! Shh! you cannot sneak up on me like that there's something I have to do in Midgar
464;37;Sindri;Male;without me? I thought we were partners
465;37;Atreus;Male;we are just wasn't sure you'd want to join me I'm visiting an old friend
466;37;Sindri;Male;oh I see or possibly not doing that taking into account she's determined to murder you
467;37;Atreus;Male;she wouldn't really
468;37;Sindri;Male;oh look I think it's lovely that you see the best in people I really do and I want you to continue to see the best in people by not getting yourself murdered
469;37;Atreus;Male;but we need her it's worth the risk
470;37;Sindri;Male;is it though? how about I suggest an alternative something much less risky but maybe could give you some answers
471;37;Atreus;Male;what are you talking about
472;37;Sindri;Male;a certain old friend you haven't seen in a while a very giant friend
473;37;Atreus;Male;Jormundandr? did you find him?
474;37;Sindri;Male;why don't I show you it's just on the way to the vengeful goddess who wants you dead so it'll give us some time to decide about not going there
475;37;Atreus;Male;so you know where Freya is
476;37;Sindri;Male;no no I mean yes but look let's just talk to the snake first and then I won't take you to Freya how's that sound
477;38;Sindri;Male;glad you brought your key of Yggdrasil I seem to have dashed out without mine
478;38;Atreus;Male;heh you got sick of having houseguests that fast?
479;38;Sindri;Male;what no if I could just use some fresh air is all
480;38;Atreus;Male;well I hope you like it cold
481;38;Sindri;Male;should we swing by your cabin first will your furry friend be joining us this time
482;38;Atreus;Male;Oh no I meant to tell you Fenrir's dead
483;38;Sindri;Male;Oh I'm very sorry to hear that as wolves go he was always very clean
484;38;Atreus;Male;thanks
485;38;Sindri;Male;I'd offer to give you a hug but why traumatize either of us further
486;39;Sindri;Male;okay caught a whiff of something awful near the Helheim tower remember how to get there?
487;39;Atreus;Male;yep just past the oarsmen but that's what makes you think Jormungandr's nearby
488;39;Sindri;Male;I know what I smelled
489;39;Atreus;Male;okay well a lot kinda happened and I need answers
490;40;Sindri;Male;anyway is that likely to happen again sudden uncontrolled bear rampage
491;40;Atreus;Male;Beats me! we've got company got my back?
492;40;Sindri;Male;they're literally made of filth I'm not touching
493;40;Atreus;Male;Who said you need to touch them?
494;40;Sindri;Male;I like the way you think okay here goes nothing
495;41;Atreus;Male;told you he's gone
496;41;Sindri;Male;well have you tried calling him
497;41;Atreus;Male;blowing the horns the first thing we try
498;41;Sindri;Male;I'm not talking about the horn
499;41;Atreus;Male;Yooooooor-mooooooo-taaaaay-oooom! Seh-nooooooo!
500;41;Sindri;Male;that's not weird at all
501;41;Atreus;Male;Shhh!

506;41;Sindri;Male;good talk
507;41;Atreus;Male;Ironwood what do you think it means
508;41;Sindri;Male;Means we should have stayed home Let's head back
509;42;Sindri;Male;Oh dear maybe this is a sign
510;42;Atreus;Male;don't be a baby I'll catch you promise not to drop you this time
511;42;Sindri;Male;I
512;42;Atreus;Male;Fine. just step between the Realms then
513;42;Sindri;Male;you know it doesn't work that way though sweet Bestla I wish it did
514;42;Atreus;Male;see was that so bad
515;42;Sindri;Male;I sincerely hope I never have to do it again if that's what you're asking
516;43;Atreus;Male;okay which way to the council as long as I go up and forward I think I'll get there eventually
517;44;Atreus;Male;hello down there
518;44;Sindri;Male;hey come to your senses yet
519;44;Atreus;Male;yes I mean uh I'm not changing my mind
520;44;Sindri;Male;Hah! you do have doubts hey
521;44;Atreus;Male;like you never do better than having regrets
522;44;Sindri;Male;I'm not sure I agree with that but by all means keep going and you might find those too!
523;45;Atreus;Male;Freya
524;45;Freya;Female;you should have stayed with Sindri
525;45;Atreus;Male;wait stop
526;45;Freya;Female;your father where is he
527;45;Atreus;Male;not here
528;45;Freya;Female;He sent you?
529;45;Atreus;Male;no he doesn't know
530;45;Freya;Female;you shouldn't have come he took my son what makes you think I won't do the same
531;45;Atreus;Male;you're better than this
532;45;Freya;Female;you would stake your life on it what do you know of me
533;45;Atreus;Male;I know you haven't killed me yet so while you're thinking it over why don't you let me go and I could tell you why I came
534;45;Freya;Female;If you mean to plead for your father save your breath his fate is sealed
535;45;Atreus;Male;but you know who's to blame for everything
536;45;Freya;Female;I cannot get to Odin nor do I need to Ragnarok will take him
537;45;Atreus;Male;Yeah, well what if I told you that he came to Midgard he came to us offered peace if we don't move against him claims Ragnarok's already been averted
538;45;Freya;Female;he lies
539;45;Atreus;Male;Maybe but if you know Gróa's prophecy you know it depends on an army of Giants
540;45;Freya;Female;the Giants wait for war in Jotunheim
541;45;Atreus;Male;No. I've been there is no Giant army there are no Giants at all Just me
542;45;Freya;Female;You?
543;45;Atreus;Male;in Jotunheim you learn the truth my mother was the last guardian of our people in Midgard and and that's not all the Giants have prophecies about me they know me as Loki I think maybe I'm supposed to help stop Odin somehow but since all the Giants are dead and you won't fight Odin then he's already won why aren't we working together now that you can fight again
544;45;Freya;Female;I am far from whole
545;45;Atreus;Male;okay okay but we found Tyr maybe if you spoke to him
546;45;Freya;Female;Tyr is alive?
547;45;Atreus;Male;Yeah we we broke him out of Svartalfheim
548;45;Freya;Female;impossible the Nine Realms are closed to all
549;45;Atreus;Male;No. we opened up the way we just don't know where to go next but if we all band together
550;45;Freya;Female;Enough enough! leave this place go and do not return go before I change my mind do not expect the same mercy for your father
551;46;Sindri;Male;ah where's your necklace
552;46;Atreus;Male;huh oh I was thinking and I uh got rid of it
553;46;Sindri;Male;she took it didn't she
554;46;Atreus;Male;Uh
555;46;Sindri;Male;today was your lucky day so tell me how did it feel to run on chaos
556;47;Sindri;Male;long before you were born there was an accident at the forge Brok died I couldn't accept it I went to the Lake of Souls in Alfheim to steal him back Legions of souls tried to stop me I can still feel them crawling all over my skin thing is I could only get three of his four soul-parts back
557;47;Atreus;Male;Sindri
558;47;Sindri;Male;Brok just thought he got knocked out I've been lying to him ever since it's been eating at me lately
559;47;Atreus;Male;you have to tell him he has a right to know
560;47;Sindri;Male;when the time is right as should you with your father
561;47;Atreus;Male;that's not the same thing
562;48;Sindri;Male;No I made a choice one that wasn't mine to make
563;48;Atreus;Male;what do you mean a choice
564;48;Sindri;Male;I couldn't be alone the other Dwarves when they saw him they shunned us so we left made our own home
565;48;Atreus;Male;well you can't change the past but it doesn't have to be who you are let's go home before father wakes up
566;48;Sindri;Male;that might be the best idea you've had all night Tre
567;48;Atreus;Male;Tre?
568;48;Sindri;Male;It's a shut up so I'm not allowed to give you a nickname
569;48;Atreus;Male;is that what that was
570;48;Sindri;Male;whatever Lok nope that was worse. I heard it when I said it
571;48;Atreus;Male;hate coming home empty-handed after Tyr was such a failure just wanted to
572;48;Sindri;Male;now hang on little Jotunn. Tyr may not be everything you expected but a failure you saved him from a terrible fate that's not nothing and hey maybe he'll be some help to us yet
573;48;Atreus;Male;Maybe but father's not going to go along with this forever it's probably already got our next hiding place all picked up
574;48;Sindri;Male;Well let's not make it worse by getting caught when we get there I'll cover our tracks at the gateway and slip around back and you just act natural
575;49;Kratos;Male;That is not the risk that concerns me do we trust the path they would put us on?
576;49;Tyr;Male;I trust their wisdom and this is the closest thing to hearing directly from them
577;49;Kratos;Male;you are certain the Giants would not counsel war?
578;49;Tyr;Male;I said that they were wise in my experience that goes with being peaceful
579;49;Mimir;Male;Oh little brother! told you we needn't worry
580;49;Kratos;Male;Atreus where have you been
581;49;Atreus;Male;Peeing
582;49;Brok;Male;hope you're all hungry
583;49;Atreus;Male;I could eat
584;49;Sindri;Male;Ahhh so everyone as well rested as I am be right down is this sausage
585;49;Brok;Male;Uh sure why not
586;49;Tyr;Male;I remember food tasting better
587;49;Brok;Male;I suppose you'd like to try cooking for this lot
588;49;Tyr;Male;I accept
589;49;Brok;Male;What?
590;49;Kratos;Male;Atreus we are planning our next move
591;49;Atreus;Male;oh so where are we going
592;49;Kratos;Male;Alfheim home of the elves
593;49;Atreus;Male;Alfheim? you hate Alfheim why would we move there?
594;49;Kratos;Male;move there No. we are seeking information
595;49;Tyr;Male;the shrine of Gróa a young one your father tells me you found it there
596;49;Atreus;Male;Gróa up the Knowledge Keeper oh maybe there's a secret there I can unlock
597;49;Mimir;Male;Aye you better than the seer-who saw everything?
598;49;Atreus;Male;I wasn't sure you um never mind that's great Alfheim
599;49;Brok;Male;Hey don't go forgetting this what will get you there
600;49;Sindri;Male;you know what I'm gonna build a bigger table
601;49;Brok;Male;more for me
602;49;Atreus;Male;Tyr you're really up for coming with us
603;49;Tyr;Male;I am whenever you're ready well whenever your father's ready I should say if my counsel might help you towards the answers you seek it's the least I can do to repay you plus I think it will do me well to see the light of Alfheim again
604;49;Brok;Male;Mmm. that elf light is some good shit.
605;49;Atreus;Male;so where did this plan come from
606;49;Tyr;Male;oh from Mimir of course I was merely asking how you found me and he explained the secret prophecies inside the Jotnar shrines fascinating
607;49;Mimir;Male;from there we set to taking stock of which shrines we'd seen at which point your father recalled finding Gróa's outside the Temple of Light and now that we can actually go to Alfheim, the prudent course of action became self-evident
608;49;Tyr;Male;Nary a lost step for the world's smartest man even without feet if you'll forgive the levity I was always fond of her talks you know
609;49;Mimir;Male;Aye and it's good to see you a free man again old friend
610;49;Tyr;Male;and thanks to you as well Brok these clothes do better than I deserve
611;49;Brok;Male;darn straight and never mind what Brok had to trade the landlord to get that Yggdrasil Seed for you
612;49;Atreus;Male;the landlord?
613;49;Sindri;Male;He's not the landlord!
614;49;Brok;Male;Heh heh heh heh
615;49;Atreus;Male;uh okay
616;50;Atreus;Male;right behind you
617;50;Tyr;Male;I'll meet you at the gateway presently friends
618;51;Ratatoskr;Male;excuse me sir mind if I take a little peek at you? I promise I'll be brief my goodness what a strapping physique capable of an astounding variety of acts of violence I imagine
619;51;Kratos;Male;what is happening
620;51;Mimir;Male;this must be the squirrel that tends the World Tree!
621;51;Ratatoskr;Male;that delectable aroma could it be pardon the intrusion ah yes amber resin delightfully nutty with a hint of squid ink
622;51;Kratos;Male;no
623;51;Ratatoskr;Male;not one for gastronomic exploration I see
624;51;Atreus;Male;wait if you're Ratatoskr why are you so different when we summon you for help
625;51;Ratatoskr;Male;it's a long story but you are correct I am indeed Ratatoskr the one you know as Ratatoskr is merely one of my spectral aspects and a particularly nasty one at that I consider him so far removed from myself that he's practically a different person speaking of bitter would you like to come out and see your friends
626;51;Bitter Squirrel;Male;fuck off I'm busy
627;51;Ratatoskr;Male;I suppose that was to be expected anyway now that I polished off all this resin for you would you like the Seed back?
628;51;Kratos;Male;It is a Seed?
629;51;Ratatoskr;Male;Indeed a Seed of Yggdrasil to be precise Since my Dwarven tenants performed their little reconfiguration you'll need Seeds like these to open up new destinations on my tree
630;51;Atreus;Male;your tree huh
631;51;Ratatoskr;Male;yes my tree here let me show you
632;52;Tyr;Male;perhaps as we travel you can tell me the tale of your prior visit to the land of the Elves
633;52;Atreus;Male;sure I can Alfheim was the first time we ever real-traveled using your temple Freya tried coming with us but Odin cast a spell on her she can't leave Midgard
634;52;Tyr;Male;that's terrible
635;52;Atreus;Male;so then we fought our way through an army of Dark Elves to get to the Light
636;52;Tyr;Male;you interfered in the Elf War
637;52;Kratos;Male;not by choice we sought to fill our Bifrost and they attacked us
638;52;Atreus;Male;and the dark elves were covering it with their sticky hive stuff when we freed it Light Elves came back things seemed better in Alfheim
639;52;Tyr;Male;did they now
640;53;Atreus;Male;It's so tall we came in from the top last time didn't realize all this was even down here
641;53;Tyr;Male;it's an older Gate built to promote cooperation between the Elves but it looks like it's been sealed for some time I'll go first Atreus let me know when I've reached halfway
642;53;Atreus;Male;so uh what's happening right now
643;53;Tyr;Male;This seal is meant to represent the balance of the realm when Freyr was here Light and Dark working together in harmony how's that look Atreus
644;53;Atreus;Male;good I think father now you go
645;53;Tyr;Male;unfortunately for Alfheim Freyr couldn't accept his sister's decision to marry Odin he returned to Vanaheim and left this realm to its fate
646;53;Mimir;Male;to be fair the Aesir did set him on fire that one time
647;53;Tyr;Male;Hmm the door should have opened are you sure it's balanced?
648;53;Atreus;Male;yeah but the realm isn't not anymore father try pulling it the other way yeah yeah and Tyr you keep pushing forward
649;53;Tyr;Male;Fine work Atreus shall we
650;54;Atreus;Male;nothing
651;54;Tyr;Male;what's wrong
652;54;Atreus;Male;I could hear Mother inside last time but I can't anymore
653;54;Tyr;Male;her soul is one with a light now united by forces older than Odin himself she is at peace Atreus
654;54;Atreus;Male;I hope so the father went inside the Light he said he
655;54;Tyr;Male;he went inside the light of Alfheim?
656;54;Kratos;Male;yes
657;54;Tyr;Male;and yet here you stand of sound mind and decidedly not incinerated you must tell me Kratos what did you see
658;54;Kratos;Male;that memory is for me alone but I felt only moments pass
659;54;Atreus;Male;didn't feel like moments to me
660;54;Kratos;Male;I was trapped Atreus overcame great odds to save me
661;54;Tyr;Male;one could but only imagine well then Gróa's Triptych awaits
662;54;Atreus;Male;so did you ever meet Gróa?
663;54;Tyr;Male;many times but she was plagued by constant visions so conversation was difficult to say the least
664;54;Atreus;Male;what are you doing
665;54;Kratos;Male;I heard something
666;54;Atreus;Male;father she's she's gone
667;54;Kratos;Male;Yes. Keep moving
668;55;Tyr;Male;Giants always did enjoy hiding their secrets in plain sight
669;55;Atreus;Male;wait until you see this
670;55;Mimir;Male;ah yes here we have Gróa's search for her missing husband she was relentless in an attempt to find him meditated for weeks on end unfortunately she found something else a vision of Ragnarok
671;55;Tyr;Male;word of Gróa's vision reached Odin he sought her out demanded a private retelling
672;55;Mimir;Male;didn't like what he had apparently
673;55;Atreus;Male;Ironwood that's the I don't know what that is
674;55;Tyr;Male;the mythical sanctuary for Giants curious
675;55;Atreus;Male;so it's in Jotunheim?
676;55;Mimir;Male;I know some Giants thought so but Ironwood isn't anywhere lad it's a concept A metaphorical paradise it's not real
677;55;Tyr;Male;presumably Gróa requested her ashes be returned to Jotunheim, while her soul found peace in the light difficult to imagine Odin respecting those wishes Hmm… the champion?
678;55;Atreus;Male;I think it's supposed to be me
679;55;Kratos;Male;you assume too much
680;55;Mimir;Male;Aye best not to read into these abstractions so literally prophecies are slippery by nature although some are more obvious than others
681;55;Kratos;Male;Ragnarok
682;55;Mimir;Male;Aye the end of everything
683;55;Atreus;Male;so this is it there's nothing we can do to stop it
684;55;Tyr;Male;there must be a way why else is this hidden
685;55;Atreus;Male;look Tyr this is what we saw It's you fighting in Ragnarok
686;55;Tyr;Male;no I don't I can't
687;55;Mimir;Male;what's this then well that's new
688;55;Atreus;Male;Asgard is destroyed but the other Realms thrive
689;55;Kratos;Male;and Odin dies
690;55;Tyr;Male;she lied
691;55;Mimir;Male;Gróa lied! of course she did Odin's working off a false prophecy
692;55;Atreus;Male;so then we can win Ragnarok we can beat Odin
693;55;Kratos;Male;we are not present in any of this
694;55;Atreus;Male;but that was Tyr leading the charge against Asgard plus Hel's army was there and the Elves, The Champion okay whoever that is doesn't matter but for the first time we know something Odin doesn't we just saw we can win Tyr?
695;55;Tyr;Male;I won't allow prophecy to Define my choices
696;55;Atreus;Male;but we just saw you
697;55;Tyr;Male;no Atreus this is wrong
698;55;Kratos;Male;Come there is much to discuss It is time
699;56;Atreus;Male;I it's gonna be okay Tyr
700;56;Tyr;Male;you've seen what is to come I told you I would not follow you to war and yet here I am dragging an innocent
701;56;Atreus;Male;innocent
702;56;Tyr;Male;and marching towards the destruction of Asgard
703;56;Atreus;Male;what choice do we have
704;56;Tyr;Male;there is always a choice I will not lead you to war I won't I'm not that God anymore I don't want to fight but with you three there is no avoiding it your path leads to countless deaths unimaginable pain and suffering
705;56;Atreus;Male;oh no no
706;56;Kratos;Male;Atreus!
707;56;Mimir;Male;Bollocks
708;56;Kratos;Male;hold on
709;56;Tyr;Male;over here your chains
710;56;Atreus;Male;ACK
711;56;Mimir;Male;ACK agreed oh
712;56;Kratos;Male;Are you injured?
713;56;Atreus;Male;no sir hey Tyr thanks and I'm sorry about before I I
714;56;Tyr;Male;No I am sorry should never have come we shouldn't linger
715;57;Tyr;Male;You want war Atreus? see for yourself the legacy this one has left for the Barrens I've had far more than I can stomach
716;58;Atreus;Male;well I hope Tyr's had enough time to find his equilibrium or whatever
717;58;Mimir;Male;indeed I saw flashes of the old God of War in them but they were fleeting
718;58;Kratos;Male;there is nothing wrong with opposing War nor opposing prophecy
719;58;Mimir;Male;I suppose that's fair Never can't be quite sure what the Giants meant by any of it
720;58;Atreus;Male;am I the only one that remembers they predicted our entire journey to Jotunheim? if the Giants saw Tyr leading armies at Ragnarok then I believe them
721;58;Mimir;Male;the question is how you'll ever make Tyr believe it
722;59;Tyr;Male;Ah! Glad to see you back young one come help me won't you
723;59;Atreus;Male;Oh sure
724;59;Kratos;Male;Atreus! Eat
725;59;Sindri;Male;oh careful careful
726;59;Tyr;Male;thank you enjoy enjoy my friends
727;59;Brok;Male;yeah we'll see about that
728;59;Tyr;Male;here you are a male fit for a Champion
729;59;Kratos;Male;enough I said we would speak no more of that
730;59;Tyr;Male;yes of course didn't mean to offend
731;59;Atreus;Male;uh I'm not offended it's just a word
732;59;Kratos;Male;A word that clouds your judgment
733;59;Atreus;Male;so you really don't think it means anything after the journey mom sent us on everything we saw in Jotunheim? what was it all for don't you ever think about that
734;59;Kratos;Male;Every day but I cannot believe her purpose was to inspire you to take foolish risks
735;59;Atreus;Male;but what if the Giants are counting on me
736;59;Kratos;Male;what Giants I'm counting on you safe to be smart to use the judgment of a man and not of a child
737;59;Atreus;Male;but what if Loki going to Ironwood it's the only way that
738;59;Kratos;Male;You are Atreus my son and nothing more do you hear me
739;59;Atreus;Male;I'm not hungry anymore
740;59;Tyr;Male;forgive me Kratos my words were chosen carelessly
741;60;Sindri;Male;you really should eat some people swear by it on almost a daily basis
742;60;Atreus;Male;I just don't understand why is there all this stuff about Loki and the Champion and Ironwood if none of it's real he's just so ungh!
743;60;Sindri;Male;mind if I give you the best advice you've heard all day and possibly ever sleep that's when all the troubles of your mind work themselves out
744;60;Atreus;Male;sure fine sleep sounds great

843;70;Atreus;Male;wait were you talking to me or the yak?
844;71;Angrboda;Female;listen I know we're out here having fun and all but maybe we should talk about what you saw on the mural
845;71;Atreus;Male;what I saw would never happen I wouldn't join Odin if it cost me my father
846;71;Angrboda;Female;If I learned anything from my mother it was that these things have a way of coming true one way or another
847;71;Atreus;Male;I learned from my father to close your heart to it but I can't not for this you know I may have thought about going to Asgard but I'd never do it
848;71;Angrboda;Female;yeah
849;71;Atreus;Male;my father wasn't helping me figure out my destiny when Odin and I were alone he offered to teach me
850;71;Angrboda;Female;If you were alone with Odin he could have easily killed you
851;71;Atreus;Male;I mean not that easily
852;71;Angrboda;Female;let's head up to that ledge
853;72;Atreus;Male;getting these ingredients feeding your animals you do this every day

859;72;Atreus;Male;at least you got an apology
860;72;Angrboda;Female;dads have a way with words huh you know maybe Odin needs you for something
861;72;Atreus;Male;or maybe it's not what it looks like maybe I'm tricking Odin
862;72;Angrboda;Female;Oh is trickery something you're good at

1062;89;Atreus;Male;but that's not all that matters who's keeping you safe
1063;89;Kratos;Male;I do not need you to protect me
1064;89;Atreus;Male;you sure about that
1065;89;Kratos;Male;what do you know

1084;91;Kratos;Male;what is it do you want
1085;91;Freya;Female;I refuse to remain bound to this realm we traveled to Vanaheim
1086;91;Brok;Male;well guess it's just us then one gateway to Vanaheim coming right up
1087;92;Mimir;Male;and what is it you expect to meet Kratos for highness clearly you've been quite capable of breaking Odin's curses on your own
1088;92;Freya;Female;The other curses grew weak from Fimbulwinter but I still needed help to break them this one is held strong
1089;92;Brok;Male;so all that trying to kill him that's just your goddessy way of asking for help?
1090;92;Freya;Female;I don't recall asking you to come along
1091;92;Brok;Male;it's because you did not I got an old drinking buddy I've been meaning to look up once this joint were back on the map got a hunch lending you mokes a hand's gonna end me up where I'm going
1092;92;Freya;Female;and what makes you think that
1093;92;Brok;Male;because last I heard tell she was running with that beef-wit brother of yours
1094;92;Freya;Female;Freyr is not a part of this
1095;92;Brok;Male;well my hunt says otherwise Scrote too
1096;92;Freya;Female;oh no something's wrong my spell I can feel it slipping
1097;92;Brok;Male;well that's Fimbulwinter for you
1098;92;Freya;Female;you don't understand I'll be torn from the realm
1099;92;Kratos;Male;what can be done
1100;92;Freya;Female;something I was hoping to avoid
1101;93;Kratos;Male;Quiet
1102;93;Freyr;Male;Now what do we have here Old one -ye and another God to do his dirty work Thor too busy
1103;93;Kratos;Male;We do not serve Odin
1104;93;Freyr;Male;No? picked a dangerous place for sightseeing then am I right?
1105;93;Mimir;Male;Now now no need for threats brother
1106;93;Freyr;Male;oh I know that voice you know I would cut off your head but it seems somebody beat me to it
1107;93;Mimir;Male;Aye oh quite observant brother
1108;93;Freyr;Male;oh oh you're no brother of mine you sold my sister to that prick
1109;93;Mimir;Male;we brokered a peace
1110;93;Freyr;Male;Oh did you now? where is it hmm and where is my sister some dungeon in Asgard is she even alive answered me I guess we'll settle for blood
1111;93;Freya;Female;stop
1112;93;Freyr;Male;what is that why do you speak in her voice
1113;93;Freya;Female;it's me Yngvi there's no time to explain just listen these men are in my service I'm here to reclaim what's been taken from me
1114;93;Freyr;Male;It's too late you can not undo what's been done
1115;93;Freya;Female;I can I will now let them pass
1116;93;Freyr;Male;So you serve my sister?
1117;93;Kratos;Male;Hrn
1118;93;Freyr;Male;Well don't we all, cut him down
1119;93;Brok;Male;what's with leaving me hanging like that you crusty hag?
1120;94;Freyr;Male;We are pretty used to only seeing Aesir in these parts don't typically get friendly faces That is a friendly face right
1121;94;Mimir;Male;his name is Kratos and no the Aesir are in Vanaheim?
1122;94;Freyr;Male;yeah we've been occupied since I have lost count
1123;94;Kratos;Male;what is your plan
1124;94;Freyr;Male;still kinda working on it
1125;94;Mimir;Male;brother I think I could be of use here if my council is welcome
1126;94;Freyr;Male;I'll take what I can get
1127;94;Mimir;Male;your mission will go considerably smoother without me In the mix come back for me when you're done
1128;95;Freya;Female;hold on something's not right Opinbera world tree roots found in Odin's damn knots that's how he did it come on
1129;95;Kratos;Male;Freya

1143;96;Freya;Female;I suppose this is the point where I forgive you or I kill you
1144;96;Kratos;Male;Have you decided?
1145;96;Freya;Female;to be honest I don't think I can do either there's still a part of me that is so angry and it'll always be it'll always be angry but no you are not the one who needs to die I do see that look everything that's happened between us
1146;96;Kratos;Male;no need to explain not to me not for that I do not regret saving your life and never will but the choice between life and death should have been yours to make I should not have robbed you of that choice
1147;97;Freya;Female;Wait, Skoll and Hati are in Vanaheim?
1148;97;Kratos;Male;we learned the Giants rescued them from Odin and brought them here
1149;97;Freya;Female;And look the sunlight wakes the sleeping roots see how they stretch to welcome the sun beautiful no? a far cry from the sheets of Midgard's snow I've grown accustomed to

1156;98;Freyr;Male;you have seen what's left of the realm right that we really mean that little to you
1157;98;Freya;Female;you question my loyalty Vanaheim turned its back on me
1158;98;Freyr;Male;oh you still can't let go of that old fight
1159;98;Freya;Female;it was my duty to save as many of our people as possible my responsibility one you didn't take seriously then and from the looks of it one you don't now
1160;98;Freyr;Male;you think this is a game to me
1161;98;Freya;Female;yeah
1162;98;Freyr;Male;we lost everything to that maniac you called husband the man's family set me on fire how did you expect me to react
1163;98;Freya;Female;like my brother like the boy that used to have my back no matter what and who I always supported no matter how selfish his choices I expected you come and find me that no matter how hurt or angry you wouldn't abandon me When I needed you the most
1164;98;Freyr;Male;Freya please I thought you were dead
1165;98;Freya;Female;yeah
1166;98;Freyr;Male;I've had to live lifetimes with those last awful words I said to you have any idea of what that's like knowing that your own selfishness hurt the person that you cared about the most Abandon tou? Freya I mourned you I have missed you so much
1167;98;Freya;Female;And I you Yngvi but I won't bind myself to another realm when I finally have my freedom I'll send help though and I will come back I promise

1169;98;Brok;Male;all right all right that's enough ain't you all got nothing better to do than gawking at family sorting squabbles come on you two not you got a few things to square with y'all
1170;99;Brok;Male;How about I set you up with some Sonic mojo call it a trade
1171;99;Freya;Female;very well
1172;99;Brok;Male;third of all if you ain't staying here bears mentioning that Sindri and I find ourselves running a flophouse for unemployed gods if you're done freezing your backside off in Midgard maybe come back with beardo there check up on your old pal Tyr
1173;99;Freya;Female;here that's kind of you Brok I may do just that
1174;99;Brok;Male;all right then I'll meet y'all back at the house unless you want me to fix anything up first
1175;99;Mimir;Male;well brother care to meet our new allies or shall we depart?
1176;100;Freya;Female;Bryna go ahead carve the letter
1177;100;Kratos;Male;Syna
1178;100;Freya;Female;it's an incantation I'll speak it Syna
1179;100;Mimir;Male;The Elves in Freyr's camp mention a gate like this in Alfheim Kept on about some sacred light Elf sanctum right past the Barrens
1180;100;Freya;Female;a trip to Alfheim
1181;101;Freya;Female;The runic word appeared over there see it Megin we should be able to reach the wedding site now I can't read that from here let's head back and I can take a better look the word is complete but I still can't read it from here let's head back down
1182;101;Kratos;Male;are you ready
1183;101;Freya;Female;yes there it is my final tie to Asgard we drove that sword into the pillar together the sword was forged for the ceremony symbol of our union Molna Molna
1184;101;Kratos;Male;the stone refuses to let go
1185;101;Freya;Female;Molna the deepest wounds form the strongest bonds bastard said it as part of our vows I hate it when he's right Asgard holds a part of me I can't sever My bond to my son to the Valkyries that damn realm isn't just Odin's it belongs to me too the pain he caused is his I refuse to keep holding on to it this sword no longer holds our legacy but it will serve as mine
1186;101;Mimir;Male;a much more fitting use for it
1187;102;Mimir;Male;Well brother before you see the lad again might we discuss an approach
1188;102;Kratos;Male;he will tell me where he has been that is my Approach
1189;102;Mimir;Male;Aye classic Spartan diplomacy
1190;102;Freya;Female;wait did you say Odin invited him to Asgard and then he disappeared for two days
1191;102;Mimir;Male;Aye but surely the lad's got more sense than to
1192;102;Freya;Female;don't underestimate Odin's powers of persuasion he filled my son's head with lies why wouldn't he do the same with yours
1193;102;Kratos;Male;Hmm
1194;103;Sindri;Male;you better screw his head back on and I mean tightly
1195;103;Atreus;Male;so you're back
1196;103;Kratos;Male;are you ready to answer me
1197;103;Atreus;Male;about what
1198;103;Kratos;Male;where did you go you see was it Odin
1199;103;Atreus;Male;what is that what you think
1200;103;Kratos;Male;do you deny it answer me did you go to Asgard
1201;103;Atreus;Male;No of course not but so what if I did it's my future it's my life
1202;103;Kratos;Male;you are my son
1203;103;Atreus;Male;then why don't you trust me
1204;103;Kratos;Male;if you want me to trust you then tell me the truth
1205;103;Atreus;Male;the truth is you're being a complete asshole
1206;103;Mimir;Male;laddie you know that's no way to change a man's mind
1207;103;Atreus;Male;he doesn't have any faith in me it's fine if he keeps secrets it's fine if mom did
1208;103;Kratos;Male;that is not fine her secrets haunt every step of this path
1209;103;Atreus;Male;oh okay so you don't believe in her anymore either
1210;103;Kratos;Male;this is not about your mother what you have done is lie
1211;103;Atreus;Male;wonder where I learned that
1212;103;Mimir;Male;that's quite enough
1213;103;Atreus;Male;since when do you always take his side
1214;103;Mimir;Male;since he became the one making sense
1215;103;Atreus;Male;look I was only thinking about going to Odin but I swear it's for a good reason
1216;103;Freya;Female;There is no good reason to go to Odin
1217;103;Tyr;Male;he'll only cloud your mind
1218;103;Atreus;Male;but I'd be going for us
1219;103;Mimir;Male;I gotta stop something bad from happening something bad did happen look at me at Freya at Tyr Odin did this to us
1220;103;Brok;Male;what's got everyone caterwauling all of a sudden
1221;103;Sindri;Male;Atreus wants to go to Asgard
1222;103;Brok;Male;Asgard He get kicked in the head or something
1223;103;Atreus;Male;great I guess everybody's against me now
1224;103;Kratos;Male;You must choose who are you going to be Are you going to continue to lie and keep things from me? Or are you my son?
1225;103;Atreus;Male;choose I never get to choose just leave me alone
1226;103;Kratos;Male;listen

1240;106;Atreus;Male;is there a gate to go through
1241;106;Skjoldr;Male;nope not unless you're an Aesir God but I guess you know that if you were an Aesir God

1259;106;Skjoldr;Male;how long you staying you don't know okay
1260;106;Atreus;Male;I'm gonna go climb that wall now
1261;107;Atreus;Male;I can do this I can do this almost there
1262;107;Heimdall;Male;hello
1263;107;Atreus;Male;uh hi
1264;107;Heimdall;Male;so what part of the enormous wall made you think oh visitors must be welcome
1265;107;Atreus;Male;I was sent for actually by Odin
1266;107;Heimdall;Male;the All-Father sent for you ha great then why are you out there and not in here
1267;107;Atreus;Male;why don't we ask them together
1268;107;Heimdall;Male;hmm are you finished now what could Odin Our Father King of the Aesir possibly want with the likes of you
1269;107;Atreus;Male;that's between me and Odin
1270;107;Heimdall;Male;you don't even know do you
1271;107;Atreus;Male;think you could pull me up or
1272;107;Heimdall;Male;no I don't think I will I think maybe I'll drop you
1273;107;Atreus;Male;no no no no no stop stop
1274;107;Heimdall;Male;yes I'm going to drop you goodbye
1275;107;Atreus;Male;wait wait think how mad the All-Father's gonna be when when he finds out you killed his guest Loki of the Jotnar?
1276;107;Heimdall;Male;heh the Jotnar enemy of my people
1277;107;Atreus;Male;I am not your enemy
1278;107;Heimdall;Male;I will be the judge of that This way Loki of the Jotnar
1279;107;Atreus;Male;Wait is that Gjallarhorn? Are you Heimdall?
1280;107;Heimdall;Male;obviously
1281;108;Heimdall;Male;just ask your questions already
1282;108;Atreus;Male;how do you know I had questions
1283;108;Heimdall;Male;it is my job next question
1284;108;Atreus;Male;what is your job
1285;108;Heimdall;Male;I protect the realm I love from trouble
1286;108;Atreus;Male;and you think I'm trouble you just met me
1287;108;Heimdall;Male;and I can already see you are eager to prove yourself way too eager probably due to an overshadowing father figure you can never live up to
1288;108;Atreus;Male;Good guess
1289;108;Heimdall;Male;I would also guess that you are disrespectful entitled and impulsive
1290;108;Atreus;Male;you don't know me at all I help people
1291;108;Heimdall;Male;oh you are here to help people hmm no no you are here to help yourself to manipulate and lie to whoever you have to to get what you want I know you're young your voice probably dropped while you were climbing the wall but what a twisted little soul you have you are chaos in a spiffy archer suit I watch your mouth move and I see cities burning nothing good is going to come from you being in Asgard that said if you are here to aid the All-Father and have no treacherous intent I guess that makes us allies
1292;109;Heimdall;Male;Gulltoppr who loves me the most who loves me the most
1293;109;Atreus;Male;wow that's almost as impressive as Baldur taming a dragon
1294;109;Heimdall;Male;Baldur had the luxury of not caring how badly he got burnt I out think them dominate them fair in school
1295;109;Atreus;Male;whoa are these all Aesir Gods
1296;109;Heimdall;Male;what you think all the Aesir are Gods
1297;109;Atreus;Male;But Skjoldr told me that only
1298;109;Heimdall;Male;well Skjoldr told you clearly whoever that is must be the authority on Aesir Gods Not the Aesir God you are currently talking to you literally know nothing of our culture do you
1299;109;Atreus;Male;I know lots of things I
1300;109;Heimdall;Male;know a giant built that wall a giant built the wall that keeps out the Giants
1301;109;Atreus;Male;Hrimthur son of Thamur I know the whole story
1302;109;Heimdall;Male;Really I truly cannot wait for you to regale me with the revisionist tales of Asgard's architectural history
1303;109;Atreus;Male;Is that Odin's Palace
1304;109;Heimdall;Male;Palace do you think the All-Father needs to puff himself up like some mortal chieftain
1305;109;Atreus;Male;I guess not
1306;109;Heimdall;Male;that is the great Lodge which the All-Father built with his own hands I'm sorry if that is a letdown for you real power you see does not need to flaunt it emerges when the time is right don't you agree
1307;109;Atreus;Male;hey
1308;109;Heimdall;Male;Hey Helmets I brought you a practice dummy
1309;110;Heimdall;Male;wow I do have to say Loki I am profoundly unimpressed you should probably stay down great
1310;110;Thor;Male;Know it off like it or not he's All-Father's guest
1311;110;Heimdall;Male;I thought I smelled something
1312;110;Thor;Male;take one more step you're not gonna like how this ends
1313;110;Heimdall;Male;really and how do you intend to stop me
1314;110;Thor;Male;look into my eyes you tell me
1315;110;Heimdall;Male;you are a sick man
1316;111;Odin;Male;Loki you made it I am so honored I I see you've met Heimdall he reads minds for me
1317;111;Heimdall;Male;the boy is false All-Father
1318;111;Odin;Male;this young man who is my guest is covered in mud care to explain
1319;111;Heimdall;Male;he means to betray you
1320;111;Odin;Male;is that true Loki you're a little trickster
1321;111;Atreus;Male;uh
1322;111;Odin;Male;I'm just messing around of course he means to betray me Heimdall why else would he come I've given him no reason to trust me not yet but he's got some very big questions and I have so many answers to get what are you up to dismissed go
1323;111;Thor;Male;gladly
1324;111;Odin;Male;and you'll clean yourself up
1325;111;Heimdall;Male;but All-Father
1326;111;Odin;Male;Heimdall will you just relax were you intending on killing me first thing see what that's not good enough for you get out of here He is a lot I know very perceptive but sometimes he just forgets to think you know hey I got some places to be
1327;112;Odin;Male;Walk with me so how'd your father take the news that you decided to accept my invitation
1328;112;Atreus;Male;I don't think we should talk about my father
1329;112;Odin;Male;that well huh can't blame them between my ex-wife and my disgruntled former employee he's not exactly getting an unbiased view but you you're curious open-minded that's important
1330;112;Atreus;Male;thank you
1331;112;Odin;Male;Hrist Mist carry on pretend I'm not here if I'm being honest with you Loki you're lucky my offer still stands after you went and sprung Tyr but I suppose spending time with him is punishment enough isn't it at least Mimir never lost his sense of humor but look that's all behind us now I like to keep looking forward hey hey hey I want them trained not decapitated just keep it below the neck all right is that really what you do when I'm not here
1332;112;Gna;Female;All-Father
1333;112;Odin;Male;Queen Gna
1334;112;Gna;Female;the Einherjarl are ready for your blessings
1335;112;Odin;Male;that's why I'm here isn't it
1336;112;Atreus;Male;huh guess there's a new Valkyrie Queen
1337;112;Odin;Male;great soldiers these Einherjar are but they tend to come out of Valhalla a little foggy I do what I can for them help them remember who they were in life that's important don't you think a sense of identity gives things meaning okay next stop
1338;113;Odin;Male;ah the books good those are for him I understand you're an avid reader these are just a few things from my Personal Collection uh thanks Jorgen those better not be mushrooms I smell
1339;113;Atreus;Male;listen I appreciate your offer but I'm
1340;113;Odin;Male;really not sure what you're expecting from me right now you're just visiting Loki one Step at a time steady there Karl
1341;113;Atreus;Male;but with all respect you need to know I came to study not to serve
1342;113;Odin;Male;another servant is the last thing I need I need someone with drive with curiosity someone will take initiative that looks good is that braised
1343;113;Atreus;Male;but why me is it because I'm half giant
1344;113;Odin;Male;big deal so is Thor Erlend try to stay awake for me

1376;115;Thrud;Female;it's new one of a kind my father gave it to me for valkyrie training
1377;115;Atreus;Male;you're in Valkyrie training
1378;115;Thrud;Female;got time to talk about it I was just heading to the Great Hall but if you need to go to work grandfather's study is just down those stairs catch you later
1379;116;Odin;Male;yes I I understand yes do you see me nodding and saying yes I understand I I uh-huh yes yes all right mm-hmm you see this is you not letting me talk no Huginn I I don't need my ears cleaned I need you to stop croaking and and and accept the answer you know I'm about to give
1380;116;Atreus;Male;I was just looking at this
1381;116;Odin;Male;that old thing I've had that since huh who can remember
1382;116;Atreus;Male;you have a name
1383;116;Odin;Male;Ingrid
1384;116;Atreus;Male;really
1385;116;Odin;Male;sure why not take it if you like it that much
1386;116;Atreus;Male;for real
1387;116;Odin;Male;consider it a perk of the job
1388;116;Atreus;Male;thank you I mean really
1389;116;Odin;Male;and they say I'm the bad guy come on let's walk
1390;116;Atreus;Male;you're welcome
1391;117;Odin;Male;everyone's got me all wrong you think War drives me or power wealth nah never have you know what drives me what I really want I want answers same as you see Mortals have it easy when they push up against life's big questions they can look to us to give them meaning Divine comfort we both know that's a sham but when we have questions why are we here to give meaning to Mortals while living without it ourselves no we are more than that and I found something that proves it
1392;117;Atreus;Male;what is it
1393;117;Odin;Male;it's what drives me you feel it don't you
1394;117;Atreus;Male;feels like knowledge truth
1395;117;Odin;Male;all truth all the answers we could find out why we're here learn how to change our Fates stop Ragnarok for good maybe save the people we love
1396;117;Atreus;Male;how
1397;117;Odin;Male;I was a young God when I found it I spent lifetimes studying it following every clue down every dead end looking for and finally unearthing this you see that it shares the same mystical energy
1398;117;Atreus;Male;it opened a crack can't we just look inside
1399;117;Odin;Male;I wouldn't recommend that
1400;117;Atreus;Male;what's the broken mask for
1401;117;Odin;Male;recognize any writing on it
1402;117;Atreus;Male;these aren't from the nine realms Smolder? Opsidiani spitha from smoldered Earth and obsidian Spark and a field of battles never fought
1403;117;Odin;Male;are you certain because if that's the clue I know what it means
1404;117;Atreus;Male;and what's that
1405;117;Odin;Male;keep working with me and find out you don't have to kill anyone you don't have to betray your father or yourself come on I know you felt what I felt the answers are in there let's get them I mean you translated this language like it was nothing
1406;117;Atreus;Male;if I do help you what's next
1407;117;Odin;Male;Thor get down here
1408;117;Thor;Male;All-Father
1409;117;Odin;Male;don't do that what's next is chasing this down take this and this stealthy side of beef let's see where It takes you
1410;117;Atreus;Male;I don't promise anything
1411;117;Odin;Male;nonsense Happy Hunting and you go easy on him you hear me
1412;118;Atreus;Male;Muspelheim? the rest of the Mask is here
1413;118;Thor;Male;it's where All-Father dropped us what do you think just take that and do your damn job listen Modi had some problems but he was my son and the only reason you aren't mush right now is because of that broken piece of wood
1414;118;Atreus;Male;look clearly neither of us can do this Mission alone and I want to impress the All-Father just as much as you do you don't have to like me but we're gonna have to trust each other just a little bit
1415;118;Thor;Male;Trust huh
1416;118;Atreus;Male;Thor what the ah wait Surtr's shrine
1417;118;Thor;Male;you didn't die over there did you
1418;118;Atreus;Male;I was thinking
1419;118;Thor;Male;well that's your problem
1420;119;Angrboda;Female;Loki you know for someone who was trained as a warrior you are tragically easy to startle
1421;119;Atreus;Male;I I didn't what are you doing here
1422;119;Angrboda;Female;a girl can't visit a shrine of her own volition
1423;119;Atreus;Male;you're here for Surtr's marble
1424;119;Angrboda;Female;Maybe
1425;119;Atreus;Male;you're out looking for more giant marbles you know what this looks like right
1426;119;Angrboda;Female;like the life story of one of our people and also maybe a storage closet
1427;119;Atreus;Male;no this looks an awful lot like defying destiny
1428;119;Angrboda;Female;the question is what are you doing here
1429;119;Atreus;Male;rewriting my story
1430;119;Angrboda;Female;Odin gave that to you
1431;119;Atreus;Male;it's not well you did but it's not I'm not working with him I would never tell him anything about Ironwood that's what you're worried about and I'm definitely not serving him
1432;119;Angrboda;Female;prophecy's words not mine I've got a marble to find you're welcome to help if you want
1433;119;Atreus;Male;fine but are you sure you're up for breaking the rules like this there aren't any Prophecies of you collecting any marbles
1434;119;Angrboda;Female;our endings haven't been written right come on champ
1435;120;Angrboda;Female;oh hello there sentient sword huh another marble Surtr's no soul in it though
1436;120;Atreus;Male;so he's still out there somewhere a while back you talked about how the Giants left you ever think about them
1437;120;Angrboda;Female;all the time they're far from here far from Odin and Thor but I wonder what lands they've gone to what seas they've crossed why
1438;120;Atreus;Male;I want to find them I'm gonna save my father and then I will find them it's starting who is that
1439;120;Angrboda;Female;not Surtr that's for sure look at all that frost
1440;120;Atreus;Male;Sinmara
1441;120;Angrboda;Female;hmm don't think I've heard of her before and here comes Surtr
1442;120;Atreus;Male;wow this must have been some fight
1443;120;Angrboda;Female;yeah until it wasn't
1444;120;Atreus;Male;it just stopped
1445;120;Angrboda;Female;oh no no no look it's because they fought together
1446;120;Atreus;Male;looks like they even became friends uh good friends
1447;120;Angrboda;Female;are they
1448;120;Atreus;Male;Yeah I think they are
1449;120;Angrboda;Female;oh well that's good for them
1450;120;Atreus;Male;but it looks like they're um love caused them to combine into some kind of huge creature
1451;120;Angrboda;Female;Ragnarok
1452;120;Atreus;Male;and then
1453;120;Angrboda;Female;Ragnarok destroys Asgard
1454;120;Atreus;Male;right I saw that in Groa's shrine
1455;120;Angrboda;Female;well that was something oh hey remember the snake we put that soul in
1456;120;Atreus;Male;can't really forget that
1457;120;Angrboda;Female;I saw it it's getting bigger like faster than normal bigger
1458;120;Atreus;Male;yeah I had a feeling that would happen
1459;120;Angrboda;Female;huh I'm gonna hang back here don't want your uh friend to see a giant he missed
1460;120;Atreus;Male;of course just be careful please
1461;120;Angrboda;Female;you too Loki
1462;121;Atreus;Male;hey Ingrid think Thor that from
1463;121;Thor;Male;you thought you could defeat thi God of Thunder
1464;121;Atreus;Male;oh through the gate like I said Thor
1465;121;Thor;Male;ain't that impressive real God stuff
1466;121;Atreus;Male;you are a God
1467;121;Thor;Male;you're damn right
1468;121;Atreus;Male;and so am I it's here this is the spot
1469;121;Thor;Male;where is in the lava
1470;121;Atreus;Male;I don't know ah damn it
1471;121;Thor;Male;some advice sticking your hand in lava is never Gonna feel good
1472;121;Atreus;Male;I wasn't thinking
1473;121;Thor;Male;good it's better that way all right let's get out of here oh don't try to play me again you're an okay kid but you are still a giant and I'll revel in killing you too
1474;122;Odin;Male;what did you do? Loki the rift got brighter look you did it
1475;122;Atreus;Male;look one of these phrases is complete now if we can read it all
1476;122;Odin;Male;but you can't translate it
1477;122;Atreus;Male;not yet
1478;122;Odin;Male;see I got a little theory I think if we can find the rest of this we can use it to look into that without you know losing an eye or worse look at this we make a good team don't we don't we make a good damn team
1479;122;Thor;Male;just like you and Baldur
1480;122;Odin;Male;you both behave out there
1481;122;Atreus;Male;Thor was really great I've learned a lot from him
1482;122;Odin;Male;you learned something from him really now okay what did you teach the kid
1483;122;Thor;Male;nothing what could I possibly teach him
1484;122;Odin;Male;exactly ah I was wondering where that went actually I had a pretty good idea change of heart
1485;122;Atreus;Male;I'm not really sure why I came to Asgard but I realize now it wasn't to be a spy I need you to know you can trust me and if I'm gonna help you take this to the end I need to be able to trust you
1486;122;Odin;Male;and trust is earned I get it take this figure out the rest of it if you're staying that is
1487;122;Atreus;Male;you're going to tell me what you're really looking for in there
1488;122;Odin;Male;translate that and I'll tell you everything and on that young man you can trust me
1489;123;Thor;Male;you like the nice things
1490;123;Sif;Female;I'm not angry I'm concerned you know that's not what I want for her
1491;123;Thor;Male;you don't want her to have a sword
1492;123;Sif;Female;but it's not about having a sword it's about what you use it for I think you know what I mean
1493;123;Thor;Male;yeah I do and I don't want that for her either okay you don't have to worry she's a smart girl smarter than her father
1494;123;Sif;Female;hm well when you are right you are right Come here
1495;123;Atreus;Male;well this has been a weird day exactly
1496;124;Mimir;Male;Good morning brother no news I'm afraid
1497;124;Kratos;Male;I have a plan
1498;124;Mimir;Male;do you now
1499;124;Kratos;Male;The Norns you found them once could you do so again
1500;124;Freya;Female;I could try but I don't see how that would
1501;124;Kratos;Male;They are the fates of these lands are they not I would know they know
1502;124;Freya;Female;you may not find them cooperative
1503;124;Kratos;Male;as long as I find them where do we search
1504;124;Freya;Female;Midgard but if Atreus is an Asgard there's no getting him back without an army we should be raising one
1505;124;Tyr;Male;yes nothing like a catastrophic War to improve the situation the boy seems quite capable perhaps if you simply give him some time
1506;124;Kratos;Male;you are not free of blame here you encouraged his foolishness his confusion I do not seek war but if Odin has stolen my son do not doubt the lengths I will go to
1507;124;Tyr;Male;your nature has always been clear Kratos but you Freya war as a first resort that's not the Freya I knew I hope the Norns can give you the counsel you need perhaps mine is no longer of use here
1508;124;Freya;Female;Tyr stop this is no time to divide ourselves further come sit please
1509;124;Kratos;Male;you have been quiet
1510;124;Mimir;Male;frankly I'm surprised you of all people would seek out fate but your instincts haven't let us down so far let's find the Norns
1511;125;Brok;Male;hang on I got something for you Sindri!
1512;125;Sindri;Male;coming
1513;125;Brok;Male;before you go traipsing off into the dawn I thought you'd like to have this back
1514;125;Kratos;Male;mmm
1515;125;Brok;Male;well don't go getting too cheery about it but you're welcome
1516;125;Freya;Female;I've collected what we need to find the Norns shall we go
1517;126;Kratos;Male;we are certain Atreus could not still be in Midgard
1518;126;Freya;Female;I was just there and found no trace if Odin invited him he must have provided a way
1519;126;Kratos;Male;no that is not the only explanation tell me where we find these Norns
1520;126;Freya;Female;I discovered some of their threads near the frozen lake I stashed one for spell crafting but we may also use it to find them just remember they really don't want to be found
1521;126;Mimir;Male;well at least things will be difficult for a change
1522;127;Kratos;Male;Come quiet she is a friend now
1523;127;Freya;Female;better they get this from you once the wolves have the scent of the Norns we'll just need to follow their lead
1524;127;Kratos;Male;Mmm I will open the gate
1525;127;Freya;Female;take care of them and they'll take care of you
1526;127;Mimir;Male;brother what exactly do you intend to ask the Norns
1527;127;Kratos;Male;how I may find my son nothing more
1528;127;Mimir;Male;you don't imagine it's a chance to clear up all this mess about prophecy perhaps get a second opinion on your alleged demise
1529;127;Freya;Female;you didn't tell me you had a death prophecy
1530;127;Kratos;Male;when Atreus and I reached Jotunheim we found a hidden mural the Giants Faye herself had foreseen our entire Journey long ago who we would meet who we would fight all of it as it happened
1531;127;Freya;Female;but you aren't dead
1532;127;Kratos;Male;that image was from a time yet to come
1533;127;Freya;Female;I see you've never struck me as someone who fears death that's not the problem is it
1534;127;Kratos;Male;No death can have me when it earns me
1535;127;Freya;Female;then maybe it's not the future that bothers you Faye sent you on your journey and she made sure you'd see that image at the end of it and you're still not sure why
1536;127;Kratos;Male;I wish to speak with this no further
1537;128;Kratos;Male;The hilt of a sword
1538;128;Mimir;Male;brother I know that sword hilt tread carefully you of all people know how weapons can carry ghosts
1539;128;Freya;Female;opnao nothing another dead end
1540;129;Baldur;Male;Mother
1541;129;Freya;Female;My boy
1542;129;Baldur;Male;I can feel everything
1543;129;Freya;Female;Baldur listen to me please
1544;129;Frigg;Female;stop why did you bring him here you are not welcome here
1545;129;Freya;Female;wait Baldur come back talk to me
1546;129;Frigg;Female;You will not touch him you will not harm him Nobody harms my boy but me
1547;129;Freya;Female;No
1548;129;Kratos;Male;Freya
1549;130;Mimir;Male;brother over here come get me I want none of this imagine them thinking I had any desire to be back on this itchy carcass
1550;130;Sigrun;Male;Mimir
1551;130;Mimir;Male;Sigrun? brother hold off
1552;130;Sigrun;Male;why did you never turn on Odin
1553;130;Mimir;Male;but I did I tried to stop him any way I could
1554;130;Sigrun;Male;don't lie to me
1555;130;Mimir;Male;Sirgun don't
1556;130;Sigrun;Male;you served Odin from the day you met to the day he put you in that tree it's who you've always been it's who you are and it's who you always will be
1557;130;Mimir;Male;brother no
1558;130;Kratos;Male;it is not her
1559;130;Mimir;Male;no of course you did what you must Brother the tree it's pulling me in
1560;130;Kratos;Male;Mimir
1561;131;Atreus;Male;father help me monster
1562;131;Kratos;Male;Atreus I am coming
1563;131;Atreus;Male;All-Father help me he is a monster
1564;132;Mimir;Male;I think it's over did we pass the test
1565;132;Freya;Female;didn't feel much like succeeding
1566;132;Mimir;Male;I see the door has disappeared
1567;132;Freya;Female;or it was never there
1568;133;Mimir;Male;That is a good lass lovely creatures but temperamental by reputation In my land they keep children away from the Lochs by telling them a Kelpie would drown them of course no Kelpie would do such a thing unless it was disrespected
1569;133;Kratos;Male;it walks on water
1570;133;Mimir;Male;Aye no mystical water steeds to speak of in Greece brother
1571;133;Kratos;Male;Hmm there were the Hippocamps they serve the sea god I battled well upon a Titan
1572;133;Freya;Female;that might not be her favorite subject
1573;134;Verdandi;Female;Kratos Freya and Mimir's head enter the home of the Norns tentatively they have finally reached their destination Kratos speaks first
1574;134;Kratos;Male;I seek my son
1575;134;Skuld;Female;I seek my son
1576;134;Urd;Female;you know the child is in Asgard no you seek what all who search for us seek to know the ending to your story
1577;134;Verdandi;Female;the ghost of Sparta furrows his brow menacingly he resists the urge to grunt
1578;134;Kratos;Male;Hmmm
1579;134;Verdandi;Female;Ohh he fails
1580;134;Urd;Female;you come to us piteous archetypes seeking freedom from your scripts as if knowing your lines would grant you the power to rewrite them
1581;134;Kratos;Male;Speak plain
1582;134;Skuld;Female;Speak plain
1583;134;Urd;Female;you will die Kratos of Sparta
1584;134;Mimir;Male;But you called him the destroyer of Fate there must be a way to subvert destiny
1585;134;Skuld;Female;But you called him the destroyer of Fate there must be a way to subvert destiny
1586;134;Urd;Female;There is no destiny puck
1587;134;Verdandi;Female;The protagonists are speechless they do not understand
1588;134;Urd;Female;there is no Grand Design no script only the choices you make that your choices are so predictable merely make us seem prescient
1589;134;Freya;Female;when my son was born shut up
1590;134;Skuld;Female;when my son was born shut up
1591;134;Freya;Female;your prophecy said he would die a needless death
1592;134;Urd;Female;and he did because you could not let him go because he thirsted for Revenge and because you killed gods
1593;134;Freya;Female;but what Kratos did it was not out of hate
1594;134;Urd;Female;should I bring him a crown then he still slays Gods but now he's sad about it you are the sum of your choices nothing more and because your choices never change you will learn that Heimdall intends to kill your son in Asgard and you will do what you do best and then Ragnarok
1595;134;Verdandi;Female;the skies burn the curtains fall Exeunt Omnes
1596;134;Kratos;Male;Heimdall?
1597;134;Verdandi;Female;again he misses the point
1598;134;Urd;Female;focusing on the second act to the exclusion of the final a common mistake in storycraft
1599;134;Kratos;Male;We are leaving
1600;134;Skuld;Female;We are leaving
1601;134;Verdandi;Female;he Stomps away followed closely by Freya
1602;134;Urd;Female;I enjoyed your story Kratos pity it has to end so soon
1603;134;Kratos;Male;let us leave this place
1604;134;Freya;Female;happily
1605;135;Mimir;Male;Oh that is better I can feel things getting more normal already
1606;135;Freya;Female;wait that tree
1607;135;Mimir;Male;well isn't that interesting
1608;135;Kratos;Male;what is this
1609;135;Mimir;Male;that's the noose brother the one Odin hanged himself with as part of his endless mad quest for secrets of life and death and what have you
1610;135;Kratos;Male;what are you doing
1611;135;Freya;Female;it's a charged object significant to Odin perhaps I'll find a use for it
1612;135;Mimir;Male;brother what they said about the boy
1613;135;Kratos;Male;will not happen
1614;135;Mimir;Male;Oh I agree
1615;135;Kratos;Male;it will not happen we will not let it
1616;136;Kratos;Male;now tell me of this power Heimdall wields he sees the future
1617;136;Mimir;Male;more like he reads the person sees their intention
1618;136;Kratos;Male;my intent will be to kill him knowing that will be no advantage
1619;136;Mimir;Male;brother this is no one to underestimate any move you make he'll have seen it coming if you must face him we need something else an edge humor me
1620;136;Kratos;Male;very well we will ask the dwarves
1621;136;Mimir;Male;ah the inevitable asking of the dwarves
1622;137;Sindri;Male;you're back they're back
1623;137;Kratos;Male;I have news
1624;137;Sindri;Male;oh did the Norns tell you how to get Atreus back do we have a plan
1625;137;Kratos;Male;The Norns say atreus will be killed by Heimdall the plan is to kill Heimdall first
1626;137;Sindri;Male;oh wow okay Heimdall let's see never loses sees everything coming unpopular at parties this won't be easy
1627;137;Kratos;Male;whatever his advantages I will overwhelm him with my own
1628;137;Brok;Male;that's the idea you gotta over populate his senses see and I got just the thing in mind to help you do it Sindri go get Draupnir
1629;137;Sindri;Male;Draupnir but we need it our supplies
1630;137;Brok;Male;aw we got plenty and to spare
1631;137;Sindri;Male;even if we did Draupnir's no weapon why would a oh you mean we combine it with
1632;137;Brok;Male;that's right
1633;137;Sindri;Male;and then when he it'll go damn you that's brilliant very well I suppose there's nothing to do but go fetch Draupnir
1634;137;Mimir;Male;Draupnir I bloody knew these two had nicked it and Odin blamed me for it disappearing
1635;137;Tyr;Male;they stole Draupnir
1636;137;Brok;Male;we didn't steal nothing we just ungifted what never should have been gifted in the first place
1637;137;Kratos;Male;How will help me kill Heimdall
1638;137;Brok;Male;never you mind all that it's a fucking surprise we are artistes
1639;137;Freya;Female;but to even store Draupnir you'd need
1640;137;Sindri;Male;You were saying
1641;137;Tyr;Male;so now you intend to kill Heimdall violence cannot prevent violence Kratos I truly thought you understood that
1642;137;Kratos;Male;No matter what you thought I understood my son is in danger I will not allow harm to come to him
1643;137;Tyr;Male;even if it means war
1644;137;Kratos;Male;what do you think
1645;137;Sindri;Male;oh I'm gonna miss you little one oh got it I think
1646;137;Tyr;Male;what had changed in you Kratos? I though you didn't believe in fate We are all worried about your son but we
1647;137;Freya;Female;enough heimdall's a threat not only to Atreus but to everyone he's Odin's left hand and he carries The Horn that begins Ragnarok if we have the chance to eliminate him we should
1648;137;Mimir;Male;and it's just as likely a trap because the bastard knows your intentions Kratos I've never seen anyone so much as lay a finger on him not one
1649;137;Brok;Male;well I gathered what's fit for gathering
1650;137;Kratos;Male;how long will it take
1651;137;Sindri;Male;we'll have to go to Svartalfheim to get the rest of the materials not to mention we'll have to visit the lady oh oh that's a relief ah ow Kratos whenever you're ready
1652;137;Kratos;Male;the lady
1653;137;Mimir;Male;no idea what he's on about brother
1654;138;Sindri;Male;ah time to go see the lady I'll take it from here
1655;138;Brok;Male;ohh no this whole thing were my idea I'll speak to the lady I never get to speak to the lady
1656;138;Sindri;Male;there are reasons for that
1657;138;Kratos;Male;Brok will go
1658;138;Sindri;Male;what no no no I have to
1659;138;Brok;Male;you heard him quit your friend I ain't gonna mess nothing up what the
1660;138;Kratos;Male;um
1661;138;Brok;Male;no you pimp shrimps think that'll keep us out well think the fuck again
1662;139;Mimir;Male;what was all that then?
1663;139;Brok;Male;Oh just Sindri trying to hog all the glory same old shit
1664;139;Mimir;Male;not that the gate what's wrong with a bloody gate
1665;139;Brok;Male;most likely someone in Nidavellir been making a fuckery of the works probably on account of all that incursioning you got up to but don't worry a little dangling head old Brok came prepared I got ways in and out from the old days gates they would never even think to look for on account of being stupid
1666;139;Freya;Female;Brok were are we
1667;139;Brok;Male;This here is you stop abandoned service tunnerl direct to the forge camp I will meet you up there
1668;139;Kratos;Male;Brok
1669;139;Mimir;Male;and he's gone you sure he was the right pick for this brother?
1670;140;Freya;Female;when we get out of here I'll give you some space let you think carefully about whether you're ready for what it means to make this weapon and to use it meanwhile I'll see what else I can learn while we're here maybe I'll send a few Einherjar back to Valhalla for good measure
1671;141;Brok;Male;hoo that's brisk I think I'll grab some for the lady
1672;141;Mimir;Male;grab some what the wind
1673;141;Brok;Male;no you idiot the sound of the Wind
1674;141;Kratos;Male;how
1675;141;Brok;Male;watch and learn see Dwarven Magic's all about the intangibles the relationship between the stuff what you can touch and what you can't it's about understanding
1676;141;Mimir;Male;understanding what
1677;141;Brok;Male;the nature of the thing is more important than the form of a thing
1678;141;Kratos;Male;hmm
1679;141;Brok;Male;hang on I smell trouble
1680;142;Kratos;Male;where is the forge
1681;142;Brok;Male;shhh here she comes I uh I uh uh she needs the final ingredient the blood of a god give her your hand wow Almost forgot Ma'am it would be an honor if you might bless it for us Are you a hello hello what the fuck was that she acts like I weren't even here
1682;142;Mimir;Male;mermaids don't speak to our corporeal bodies they speak to a part of our soul a part specifically you might be missing
1683;142;Brok;Male;fuck fuck Dammit Sindri you lying scat-scrubber I knew it I died I fucking died the fuck you want
1684;142;Kratos;Male;it needs a blessing
1685;142;Brok;Male;yeah well the one to give us a blessing just fucked off into the kelp
1686;142;Kratos;Male;it needs the blessing of a great blacksmith
1687;142;Brok;Male;what no no I can't bless shit I don't have all my soul bits the blessing wouldn't mean squat
1688;142;Kratos;Male;it is the nature of a thing that matters not it's form
1689;142;Brok;Male;all right may this weapon strike true may it be wielded with wisdom may it be put down when its job is done
1690;142;Kratos;Male;Let us return home
1691;142;Mimir;Male;oh is that the way down
1692;142;Brok;Male;and I'll get those Gates working for you
1693;142;Mimir;Male;I only hope Sindri in one piece by the time Brok's done with him the ice beneath those two is thin enough under the best of circumstances
1694;143;Mimir;Male;where is everyone
1695;143;Odin;Male;now a good time I just want to talk dad to Dad speaking of which imagine my surprise when Atreus came knocking at my door he's doing well by the way and we'll continue to do so just as long as I return to Asgard sometime soon besides our friend here has a has a whole lot to live for
1696;143;Durlin;Male;arguable
1697;143;Odin;Male;run along now but behave yourself new spear never much care for Brok but can't deny the dwarf's talent
1698;143;Kratos;Male;you came to speak speak
1699;143;Odin;Male;you don't really want war do you Kratos all that blood on your hands on your son's hands I want peace as much as you do perhaps we can find it together
1700;143;Mimir;Male;He is lying
1701;143;Kratos;Male;I know
1702;143;Odin;Male;that boy of ours he is everything I expected so clever kind he's sure he's yours I kid you really ought to be very proud he is the key to peace in our age to break free from all this fate and prophecy
1703;143;Kratos;Male;my son is not your key
1704;143;Odin;Male;oh God do they not have metaphor in your Homeland or rather did they I'm sorry that's not fair I know you're not the god you once were and now is your chance to prove it
1705;143;Kratos;Male;return my son or you may meet God I once was
1706;143;Odin;Male;and what kind of God is that Kratos what do you even know of godhood in your lifetimes has anyone ever worshiped you ever prayed to you can you even imagine that kind of love no you don't care about Mortals you don't care about anything beyond yourself beyond the monster who kills without cause you fear what you can never even hope to understand is it any wonder that your a boy is in no rush to come back to you
1707;143;Mimir;Male;don't listen to him brother he is just trying to get in your head
1708;144;Freya;Female;hmm so this Draupnir spear you're prepared to use it
1709;144;Kratos;Male;to protect Atreus I am no one's Champion but his nor no one's God that may be my form it is not my nature do you understand
1710;144;Freya;Female;I guess a difference of opinion is hardly the most I'm setting aside for this Alliance as long as the plan is to kill Heimdall the rest matters little
1711;144;Mimir;Male;there's also the bit of news that Odin has some inkling of what we're up to
1712;144;Freya;Female;I thought I heard ravens damn it what did he say
1713;144;Mimir;Male;Lies threats and more lies what did you expect
1714;144;Kratos;Male;you think he lies that Atreus is in Asgard?
1715;144;Mimir;Male;no on that I'm afraid I believe him
1716;144;Kratos;Male;then the rest matters little
1717;144;Freya;Female;I saw a Gateway near here overlooking the bay we can get to it with your spear I think
1718;145;Freya;Female;now that you have a weapon to deal with Heimdall we just need to find a way to get to him
1719;145;Mimir;Male;Aye if that's still the plan
1720;145;Kratos;Male;it is I will protect my son
1721;145;Mimir;Male;so then it seems the original plan to avoid Ragnarok has fallen a bit by the wayside
1722;145;Kratos;Male;that is up to Odin
1723;145;Mimir;Male;yes that's rather what concerns me listen brother those things he said to you
1724;145;Kratos;Male;his words are nothing
1725;145;Mimir;Male;true though I expect retaliation is no empty threat we need to think through the ins and outs of it
1726;145;Kratos;Male;hmmm
1727;145;Freya;Female;you're getting ahead of yourself let's see if Sindri has had any luck
1728;146;Brok;Male;there he is hey come show off this spear see what we done now do the thing
1729;146;Sindri;Male;oh look at that she's special that one
1730;146;Brok;Male;ain't gotta tell me
1731;146;Kratos;Male;have you found a way to reach Asgard
1732;146;Sindri;Male;um not as such had a few ideas but they didn't so much work
1733;146;Mimir;Male;brother without a way to Asgard what are we doing
1734;146;Kratos;Male;I do not know I need to think I am tired
1735;146;Mimir;Male;where are you going brother
1736;146;Kratos;Male;sleep
1737;146;Mimir;Male;so we are just keeping blindly on then hoping we don't walk headlong into Ragnarok is that your plan
1738;147;Faye;Female;Kratos you all right shhhh well your father seems very ready to go shall we then this way grumbles
1739;148;Faye;Female;mmm do you enjoy the gentle waves little one your father and I traverse this river often one day you will learn to navigate its waters we live deep in the Wildwoods the most beautiful forest in all of Midgard it is safe and serene here game is plentiful and you will want for nothing we are not far from the place your father and I first met we nearly took each other's heads off but he's softened since then somewhat unfortunately for you remains dreadfully stoic
1740;148;Kratos;Male;Mrrhn
1741;148;Faye;Female;I suppose it will fall to me to teach you language your father can teach you to hunt or perhaps that will fall to me as well since all he seems to be good for is grunting
1742;148;Kratos;Male;hmmm
1743;148;Faye;Female;have you nothing to say to your son
1744;148;Kratos;Male;what would you have me say Faye
1745;148;Faye;Female;anything let him learn your voice let him know you
1746;148;Kratos;Male;he is far better off knowing as little as possible
1747;148;Faye;Female;knowledge is not always a burden to think the Mighty God of War frightened of his own child
1748;148;Kratos;Male;I do not fear our child Faye I fear for him he is innocent
1749;148;Faye;Female;we are not our failures we are not who we were we must be better Atreus is our future Keep him safe Kratos protect our son
1750;149;Skjoldr;Male;what did that wall ever do to you
1751;149;Atreus;Male;I am building Focus something my father taught me
1752;149;Skjoldr;Male;it work
1753;149;Atreus;Male;not yet
1754;149;Skjoldr;Male;so what you focusing on anyway
1755;149;Atreus;Male;controlling my emotions Heimdall keeps trying to make me lose my cool I can't give into it
1756;149;Skjoldr;Male;Thrud hey it's Thrud okay be cool
1757;149;Thrud;Female;training without me
1758;149;Skjoldr;Male;haha is that a that a good idea training I mean I think it's a great idea but uh won't your mom be mad if she finds out
1759;149;Thrud;Female;good point but did you consider
1760;149;Skjoldr;Male;no I didn't that didn't hurt also
1761;149;Thrud;Female;anyways grandfather wants to see you
1762;149;Skjoldr;Male;oh grandfather right okay uh here then take this and uh send my regards to Sif lady Sif and Atreus see you later and Thrud bye Thrud

1766;149;Atreus;Male;what is in the jar?
1767;149;Thrud;Female;Milk curd mom's favorite it's his way of helping grandfather's in this study catch up later
1768;150;Sif;Female;you don't need to know why things are done you just need to accept what
1769;150;Thrud;Female;but I'm old enough
1770;150;Sif;Female;this isn't about your age
1771;150;Thrud;Female;then what is it about because by this point Magni and Modi
1772;150;Sif;Female;were set on the path that led to their death I don't understand
1773;150;Thrud;Female;you never try to
1774;150;Sif;Female;then help me why are you so intent to walk the same path and with that boy no less
1775;150;Thrud;Female;it is not about him I just this is my dream haven't you ever
1776;150;Sif;Female;you're not some farmhand we are Aesir we have duties not dreams and you need to start acting like it
1777;150;Thrud;Female;sometimes I hate you
1778;151;Atreus;Male;hmm not here maybe Odin's down in this Library
1779;152;Odin;Male;what are you going on about?
1780;152;Thor;Male;I just don't get it the mask bringing the giant that killed my sons here why
1781;152;Odin;Male;well I can explain it to you but I can't understand it for you stop letting a wife think for you she's clouding whatever's left of your brain
1782;152;Thor;Male;this isn't about her
1783;152;Odin;Male;no it's about your limitations accept them and move on now go smash something will ya honestly I liked you better as a drunk
1784;153;Odin;Male;Loki come here
1785;153;Atreus;Male;I finally figured it out this is where you killed Ymir isn't it first Giant
1786;153;Odin;Male;tell me can you murder a landslide smother a storm it was more a force of nature a vessel of power I was young foolish so an opportunity to create something more I know you think it's cruel but I did what I had to to protect my own
1787;153;Atreus;Male;why build your house here what's in there if I'm gonna trust you
1788;153;Odin;Male;shhh I'm trying to tell you in the wake of Ymir's death I saw something the rift possibly the birthplace of reality I looked inside and something was there looking back at me it whispered to me things I couldn't possibly comprehend but I knew they were true when it blinded me I thought it was over that I'd never see inside again and then I found this and I knew that it would finally let me see the answers you see son I don't know where I go when I go there's no Valhalla for me Ragnarok cannot be the end I need to know that something more than this I need to know what happens to me and that's the truth I swear on my last good eye that's the truth
1789;153;Atreus;Male;the writing on here talks about a cold breath breath wind it's got to be Helheim
1790;153;Odin;Male;Helheim you say? I'll take it and I know just the person to accompany you I'm trusting you two can handle this responsibility
1791;153;Thrud;Female;you can count on us don't mess this up for me
1792;153;Odin;Male;oh I forgot to mention Heimdall will be joining you
1793;153;Heimdall;Male;what a privilege for all of us

1798;154;Thrud;Female;nah we're gonna make the most of this
1799;154;Heimdall;Male;now as much as I would love to babysit I have something else to do for the All-Father if you run into any trouble just scream so I know where to find your bodies

1819;156;Thrud;Female;leave him alone it was a mistake

1833;157;Heimdall;Male;damn he's not here let's check his study oh boy is he going to lose it
1834;157;Thrud;Female;father will have my back
1835;157;Heimdall;Male;after the All-Father sent him away sulking with his tail between his legs doubtful and you Loki of the Jotnar I am haunted by your incompetence it keeps me up at night
1836;158;Odin;Male;may I come in I heard what Heimdall had to say I'd like to hear it from you what happened
1837;158;Atreus;Male;it wasn't there I was wrong well
1838;158;Odin;Male;we all make mistakes son but freeing Garm that was a big one chaos is already spilling out into the other realms we're safe here in Asgard but everywhere else
1839;158;Atreus;Male;I think I want to go home now
1840;158;Odin;Male;okay if that's what you want I meant it when I said you're not a prisoner here it's your choice go clear your mind I know you'll be back but before you go I'll need the mask back that's not that I don't trust you you understand It's the company you keep oh and Ingrid

1857;161;Atreus;Male;It's all my fault the Hel-Walkers they're everywhere everywhere
1858;161;Kratos;Male;that is not your fault
1859;161;Atreus;Male;yes it is there was a wolf in Hel he was in chains and and I set him free I I thought that if

1861;161;Tyr;Male;Garm who freed Garm that's madness surely not you young one
1862;161;Freya;Female;if the Hound of Hel is loose he'll chew through the fabric of the Realms Hel-Walkers are just the beginning what were you thinking
1863;161;Mimir;Male;Aye this is a fuck up of not insignificant proportions
1864;161;Tyr;Male;what would drive you to such mischief is this Loki's doing
1865;161;Kratos;Male;enough leave him the Atreus has made a mistake one that we will fix together
1866;161;Mimir;Male;Grand now if you don't mind I'd rather stay here I've had my fill of visits to Helheim
1867;162;Atreus;Male;One problem I am not sure I have a way back to Helheim

1901;168;Kratos;Male;in Asgard
1902;168;Atreus;Male;this has nothing to do with that
1903;168;Kratos;Male;more secrets

1905;168;Kratos;Male;Home
1906;169;Atreus;Male;what's wrong
1907;169;Kratos;Male;I have been falling back into my old ways angry distrustful with you now and before I I chased you away
1908;169;Atreus;Male;without you I got reckless overconfident made stupid mistakes I don't know why I thought I could do this alone you were right
1909;169;Kratos;Male;no on our journey together you have grown into a warrior worthy of your namesake I was the one who was not ready
1910;169;Atreus;Male;you don't have to be who you were just because I'm not there let's make a promise I'll listen for your voice in my head when you're not there to guide me and you do the same alright I need to know you'll be okay without me
1911;169;Kratos;Male;Atreus I am sorry
1912;169;Atreus;Male;don't be sorry Father be better let's go home
1913;170;Atreus;Male;did you want to take care of anything before going back to Sindri's
1914;170;Kratos;Male;no first we retrieve Mimir then you can tell us what you learned in Asgard after that we shall see
1915;170;Atreus;Male;you really do think of him as a brother what about Freya seems like she moved in while I was away
1916;170;Kratos;Male;once she turned her hatred back to Odin she recognized our interests were aligned
1917;170;Atreus;Male;huh I tried convincing her of that but
1918;170;Kratos;Male;when was that
1919;170;Atreus;Male;oh before I started telling you where I was at night
1920;170;Kratos;Male;I see
1921;170;Atreus;Male;hey she didn't kill me
1922;170;Kratos;Male;I said nothing
1923;171;Tyr;Male;you are back how did it go
1924;171;Kratos;Male;the beast should trouble us no further
1925;171;Mimir;Male;well that's a bloody relief so you have put down old Garm did you
1926;171;Atreus;Male;yeah sort of
1927;171;Freya;Female;Atreus your decision to go to Asgard after all he's put us through I'll never understand it but I hope you at least came back with something we can use
1928;171;Atreus;Male;I hope so too come on let me show you what Odin's up to here's what he cares about most more than Ragnarok or anything is this mask anyone recognize it
1929;171;Mimir;Male;that thing ucch it's a dead end he's been faffing around with that since before I knew him to be honest I thought the Giants were just having a laugh with that one
1930;171;Sindri;Male;okay fine no
1931;171;Tyr;Male;you're wrong Mimir this mask is no fraud the Giants didn't make it and only a few of them ever glimpsed it in their visions they never knew its origin but some believed it was a way to gaze into the secrets of creation itself
1932;171;Kratos;Male;is it an oracle
1933;171;Tyr;Male;much much more imagine becoming one with a source of infinite knowledge this is why Odin tortured me
1934;171;Atreus;Male;so what do you think know it
1935;171;Freya;Female;no it's one obsession he never saw fit to share with me but I'll tell you this even when Odin speaks the truth his purpose is false either way it's a mistake to let it distract us is Heimdall our focus or not
1936;171;Kratos;Male;we will rewrite our fate another way
1937;171;Freya;Female;then I'm going back to Vanaheim if we're not taking the fight to Odin I should help my brother stand against him
1938;171;Kratos;Male;we will join her when we can
1939;172;Atreus;Male;hey wait we're with you
1940;172;Kratos;Male;we travel to Vanaheim
1941;172;Atreus;Male;great I'm gonna check in on Freya
1942;172;Kratos;Male;yes
1943;172;Atreus;Male;glad I get to come this time
1944;173;Atreus;Male;so what happened the last time you were in Vanaheim I still don't know how you got Freya to stop trying to kill you
1945;173;Kratos;Male;we traveled to her village to break Odin's spell once freed she accepted I was not her enemy
1946;173;Mimir;Male;you also missed a highly entertaining moment where Brok was lifted ass over face in Freyr's camp
1947;173;Atreus;Male;you met Freyr what's he like
1948;173;Kratos;Male;different from his sister lacks her conviction
1949;173;Mimir;Male;True but he's a bit quicker to forgive
1950;173;Kratos;Male;and an ineffective leader
1951;173;Mimir;Male;But his heart's in the right place you'll like him lad
1952;174;Hildisvini;Male;Kratos Atreus A welcome reunion unexpected but welcome
1953;174;Mimir;Male;you know us can't be is that who I think oh you shifty bastard it's almost good to see you again and for once in the shape of a man or nearly
1954;174;Hildisvini;Male;so that's how they've got your head out of your ass maybe now you'll stop being such a half-blind piss drunk oversexed liar he was more of a pig than I ever was
1955;174;Kratos;Male;I do not know you
1956;174;Hildisvini;Male;do not recognize your handiwork
1957;174;Atreus;Male;Hildisvini remember when we first met Freya in the woods after I oh I am so so sorry about that
1958;174;Kratos;Male;Freya's boar
1959;174;Hildisvini;Male;her advisor and friend counselor to the Vanir and yes while exiled at Midgard I was trapped in my bull form and then you shot me
1960;174;Kratos;Male;at my command
1961;174;Atreus;Male;no my arrow I mistake
1962;174;Hildisvini;Male;forgotten Vanaheim needs our help more than ever even Mimir's come just watch where you aim that bow of yours my hide's not so thick in this form we can head out whenever you're ready
1963;174;Atreus;Male;where are we going
1964;174;Hildisvini;Male;I have a favor to ask I'll explain on the way
1965;175;Atreus;Male;Here goes nothing just like inside their shrine If I do this
1966;175;Kratos;Male;Fate only binds you if you let it do what's necessary not because it is written
1967;175;Atreus;Male;Elta
1968;175;Mimir;Male;good choice lad
1969;175;Atreus;Male;they have a gift for us a way to call them anytime we need them

1974;176;Kratos;Male;go with him Atreus I will Aid Freya
1975;176;Atreus;Male;Yes sir
1976;177;Freya;Female;we're coming for you Yngvi

1995;183;Kratos;Male;this is your final warning

2040;187;Hildisvini;Male;damn it Birgir
2041;187;Freyr;Male;oh come on you really think that's the end of Birgir
2042;187;Hildisvini;Male;you think he survived that
2043;187;Freyr;Male;he's down there picking the dirt out of his nails with the beast's feathers we'll see he ugh he has to be
2044;187;Freya;Female;we're almost there Yngvi just hold on a bit longer
2045;187;Freyr;Male;Don't suppose I have much of a choice at the moment
2046;188;Freya;Female;Lunda Lunda we need cloth and boiling water red root and
2047;188;Lunda;Female;and Lamb's Cress I know I know you think I never staunched a bleeder before oh now don't you go worrying boss I didn't go through any of your stuff while you was off being tortured
2048;188;Freyr;Male;Ahh damn it Lunda easy
2049;188;Lunda;Female;the heck you sassing me for I ain't the one who stuck you like a damn pig no offense
2050;188;Freyr;Male;Freya mind giving her a hand or just taking over entirely
2051;188;Freya;Female;hold still she'll just get you stable so I can take you to Sindri's house the rest of my herbs are there
2052;188;Hildisvini;Male;we'll protect the realm in your absence the four of us
2053;188;Freya;Female;Vanaheim's in good hands
2054;188;Freyr;Male;party at Sindri's house then wherever that is
2055;188;Kratos;Male;your boat
2056;188;Freyr;Male;nope your boat go on take it sail the skies sun yourself on its bow you look like you could use it make a Vanir god proud
2057;188;Atreus;Male;he gave you his boat nice
2058;188;Kratos;Male;he left me no choice
2059;188;Atreus;Male;because it was necessary not because it was written
2060;189;Atreus;Male;I wanted to tell you I read something in Odin's Library about what Gjallarhorn is supposed to do if blown by a god it sounds to all the realms and harmonizes the space between them blow it somewhere like Tyr's Temple and it would be like opening up all the realm travel towers at once
2061;189;Mimir;Male;it's quite a vulnerability wonder why he didn't just destroy it
2062;189;Kratos;Male;some artifacts defied destruction
2063;189;Mimir;Male;well we should make Freya aware of this
2064;190;Freyr;Male;it's not your herbs talking you are the best you have always been the best hey you think Sindri's got any more snacks
2065;190;Kratos;Male;enough
2066;190;Freyr;Male;look at that you really did it how and all the nine realms did you managed to kill Heimdall
2067;190;Brok;Male;I knew our spear would do the trick well happy Ragnarok everybody let's drink
2068;190;Tyr;Male;is it true Heimdall's dead I can't believe it there's no stopping it now Odin swore peace only so long as you spilled no more Aesir blood
2069;190;Kratos;Male;I refused that deal
2070;190;Tyr;Male;yet he honored it but now
2071;190;Freya;Female;but what you and I know better than anyone that Odin's promises never last we have the advantage now it's time to bring him down
2072;190;Kratos;Male;No
2073;190;Tyr;Male;none of you understand what's coming Odin's vengeance will be his only concern
2074;190;Atreus;Male;not his only concern the mask whatever knowledge it unlocks that's what Odin wants more than anything if I go back to Asgard I can use
2075;190;Kratos;Male;Go back go back
2076;190;Atreus;Male;look if I can finish what I started there awaken the mask get answers maybe that's our way out of this but I gotta go soon before they figure out what's happened
2077;190;Kratos;Male;Atreus you are home do not ask me to put you at risk again
2078;190;Tyr;Male;he's at risk where he stands Kratos we all are
2079;190;Atreus;Male;anything we do or don't do is dangerous right now but Odin needs me he trusts me I'll be safe there from a tactical perspective am I wrong
2080;190;Mimir;Male;I don't much like it but it is our best play dividing Odin's focus would buy us time
2081;190;Tyr;Male;and give us a pair of eyes in the enemy's inner sanctum
2082;190;Freya;Female;but if there is truly a source of infinite knowledge you can't let Odin have it
2083;190;Mimir;Male;Aye and once he has what he needs from you
2084;190;Atreus;Male;Then I lose my leverage I get it I'll be smart father I can do this
2085;190;Kratos;Male;remember our promise
2086;190;Atreus;Male;you too
2087;190;Sindri;Male;I hope you know what you're doing
2088;190;Atreus;Male;I do too Sin
2089;190;Freyr;Male;well I still want to hear how you did it
2090;190;Mimir;Male;you mean how we did it Aye you heard me and therein lies a tale
2091;191;Sindri;Male;Atreus listen I can't let you go back without this
2092;191;Atreus;Male;a hammer
2093;191;Sindri;Male;your key please you ever need a way out of a bad situation throw this down hard and say Hvergi one use only
2094;191;Atreus;Male;Hvergi thanks Sindri hope I don't need it
2095;191;Sindri;Male;me too
2096;192;Atreus;Male;all right Odin said Huginn would be waiting in the cabin Mimir anything else I should know about Odin maybe a weakness or something like if I flip up his eye patch he'll disintegrate Aye lad wouldn't that be Yeah no sorry Mimir I can't do your accent I'm on my own for this one
2097;193;Atreus;Male;Fen you made it back hey
2098;193;Angrboda;Female;this is your wolf
2099;193;Atreus;Male;Ahh stop doing that

2105;193;Atreus;Male;me too hey uh how'd you find me here Loki this is my marble
2106;193;Angrboda;Female;and where are you heading off to

2108;193;Angrboda;Female;uh-huh
2109;193;Atreus;Male;Angrboda look once I see this through I'm gonna Know everything how to save my father had to stop Ragnarok and maybe hopefully how to bring our people back
2110;193;Angrboda;Female;Loki those are all very noble intentions but he's Odin
2111;193;Atreus;Male;you have faith in me right
2112;193;Angrboda;Female;of course I do I just hope the story you're writing for yourself is the one that you truly want
2113;193;Atreus;Male;you would you take care of Fen while I'm away
2114;193;Angrboda;Female;I'll take good care of him won't I boy be careful Loki
2115;194;Atreus;Male;Okay Alright I just gotta help out and complete the mask but also make sure he doesn't get any answers from me
2116;195;Odin;Male;Heimdall's dead happen to know something about that anything
2117;195;Atreus;Male;well I mean everyone hated him
2118;195;Odin;Male;sure sure but have you seen anything something noteworthy
2119;195;Atreus;Male;I mean you know he did sock Thrud pretty hard while we were out maybe someone found out even I I don't know
2120;195;Odin;Male;are you suggesting my son had something to do with this
2121;195;Atreus;Male;I don't know honest
2122;195;Odin;Male;well I had to ask never believed you had anything to do with this I'm glad you're back
2123;195;Atreus;Male;so I figured out what went wrong I mistranslated a word here
2124;195;Odin;Male;did you now
2125;195;Atreus;Male;I thought it said beyond the cry of cold breath but it actually reads the cry of first breath
2126;195;Odin;Male;well that's somewhere else entirely I know where that is young man you've done it again go take the mask take the sword take the bird find Thor you are going to Niflheim

2181;199;Thor;Male;you're welcome
2182;199;Odin;Male;I'm sorry you are here why

2185;199;Sif;Female;you said no more Aesir your blood would be spilled you said family comes first you don't think that this is retribution for him being here he's put your granddaughter in danger he's made your son miserable
2186;199;Odin;Male;Loki didn't kill Heimdall his father did your daughter is old enough to make her own mistakes and your husband started drinking again all on his own dismissed you two a word
2187;200;Sif;Female;Can't you see what's happening he's not protecting us Magni Modi our boys we used to tell them stories by the fire do you remember we would carve those wooden horses we would play and laugh until the sun sank and they fell asleep in our laps they were thrown at the All-Father's problems like brittle knives to a mountain face and for what what if Thrud's next
2188;200;Thor;Male;you you kill my sons sleep in their beds turn my father against my daughter
2189;200;Atreus;Male;I have no idea what's happening
2190;200;Thor;Male;you know I finally thought of something I can teach you
2191;200;Odin;Male;Hey stand down
2192;200;Thor;Male;Jotunn
2193;200;Atreus;Male;Sindri better be right Hvergi
2194;200;Odin;Male;No
2195;200;Atreus;Male;Ahhhhhhhhh
2196;201;Atreus;Male;Sindri oh you sure know how to plan an exit
2197;201;Kratos;Male;Atreus
2198;201;Mimir;Male;glad you're safe lad
2199;201;Atreus;Male;got out just in time pretty sure I burned my bridges in Asgard though wait why were you out here
2200;201;Kratos;Male;Sindri told us where you would arrive should you find trouble
2201;201;Atreus;Male;Oh I thought you might have been exploring without me
2202;201;Mimir;Male;No lad your dad was just concerned though now that you mention it
2203;201;Kratos;Male;Mimir
2204;201;Mimir;Male;Brother please it's all so crowded and tense back home don't you miss the three of us out finding our own adventures
2205;201;Kratos;Male;putting off the inevitable
2206;201;Mimir;Male;exactly
2207;201;Atreus;Male;it's not the worst idea I do want to show everyone The Mask but it'll keep
2208;202;Atreus;Male;I am back everybody
2209;202;Freyr;Male;Ey hey hey He is back
2210;202;Sindri;Male;it worked you made it
2211;202;Atreus;Male;I'll get Tyr join us at the table if you're ready to stay
2212;202;Sindri;Male;see I told you the key would get him home
2213;202;Freya;Female;because you tapped it with a hammer
2214;203;Tyr;Male;all you've done is steal Odin's greatest treasure just after your father's killed his most loyal ally none of us are safe even here
2215;203;Freya;Female;so we have no choice we find Surtr sound Gjallarhorn and bring Odin to justice now
2216;203;Tyr;Male;you'd incinerate every soul in Asgard and call it self-defense
2217;203;Freyr;Male;does he ever suggest plans or just crap on everyone else's
2218;203;Tyr;Male;the obvious plan is staring you in the face we don't need Odin to use this we can slip into Asgard and do it ourselves right under his nose we gain the knowledge we need to shatter this prophecy of War once and for all
2219;203;Sindri;Male;except begging your pardon you don't have a way into Asgard
2220;203;Brok;Male;they got the big horn don't they
2221;203;Sindri;Male;oh so you expect them to sneak into Asgard blowing a horn that sounds across all the realms
2222;203;Brok;Male;I expect you to bite my blue buttcheek
2223;203;Tyr;Male;please just think about it
2224;203;Kratos;Male;This mask the easy answers that it promises I know this shortcuts always have a price Atreus you have carried it what do you think
2225;203;Atreus;Male;I think it's a chance at worse we'll have something Odin wants as leverage at best if it really gives us all the answers then we can make our own path and nobody has to die
2226;203;Kratos;Male;hmm
2227;203;Mimir;Male;Grand now all we need is a way to Asgard
2228;203;Tyr;Male;I know I've been a burden to you all I know you've questioned why you even pulled me out of that hole I have too but it's clear now this is what I'm needed for this is my purpose one last time I will pick up my spear and I will lead us to Asgard
2229;203;Brok;Male;excuse me but if you got a way to Asgard where's that idea been this whole fucking while
2230;203;Mimir;Male;that's rather a fair question brother
2231;203;Kratos;Male;you withheld Asgard
2232;203;Tyr;Male;you would have gotten us all killed and we needed to give Loki time to find his destiny here it is it's all led to this
2233;203;Freya;Female;if we can get inside I'm going after Odin
2234;203;Kratos;Male;I will not stop you we can do both
2235;203;Mimir;Male;spot on brother if the Mask doesn't give us an out we'll still have the drop on him
2236;203;Freyr;Male;works for me
2237;203;Freya;Female;let's do it then and quickly before he sees us coming
2238;203;Tyr;Male;he does hate surprises
2239;204;Brok;Male;slow down you damn spruce I still want to hear the details on this uh new way to Asgard you got spill it
2240;204;Tyr;Male;it's an ancient path we can't reach it from here
2241;204;Brok;Male;where then?
2242;204;Tyr;Male;let me collect my things and I'll show you
2243;204;Brok;Male;you ain't got no things and where are you going with that mask
2244;204;Tyr;Male;Brok
2245;204;Brok;Male;that belongs to the kid he earned it all you've done was make passable dirt soup
2246;204;Atreus;Male;Brok it's okay
2247;204;Brok;Male;no it ain't this ain't right all the pieces ain't welding together true like what's with him calling you Loki anyway you know that ain't his name hey I'm talking to you
2248;204;Tyr;Male;do you never shut up
2249;204;Sindri;Male;Brok
2250;205;Odin;Male;of all the things
2251;205;Kratos;Male;Odin
2252;205;Freya;Female;let go of the boy and face me
2253;205;Odin;Male;tell your brother to throw me the mask and you've got a deal
2254;205;Kratos;Male;Stop moving
2255;205;Sindri;Male;Freya
2256;205;Freya;Female;if he dies
2257;205;Odin;Male;now now wasn't part of the plan but if he dies we are square for Heimdall and honestly you got a bargain
2258;205;Freya;Female;I will kill you plan on that
2259;205;Odin;Male;mmm so nice spending time with you again
2260;205;Sindri;Male;Freya please
2261;205;Odin;Male;ah ah ah can't be in two places at once Frigg hey I don't move you don't move don't do anything you'll regret
2262;205;Kratos;Male;I regret many things killing you will not be one of them release my son
2263;205;Odin;Male;I'm in control here throw me the mask now
2264;205;Kratos;Male;Atreus
2265;205;Odin;Male;ahh
2266;205;Kratos;Male;Atreus Atreus
2267;205;Odin;Male;too bad son looks like war after all
2268;206;Sindri;Male;please you have to save him you have to he can't you can't maybe if I go back to the lake
2269;206;Brok;Male;stop it I know what you've done and I forgive you but you got to stop you got to let go
2270;206;Sindri;Male;Brok
2271;207;Atreus;Male;this whole time
2272;207;Freyr;Male;so uh what do we do now
2273;207;Freya;Female;now now we kill Odin and anyone who gets in our way
2274;207;Kratos;Male;Atreus come
2275;207;Atreus;Male;what where
2276;207;Kratos;Male;it does not matter
2277;207;Freya;Female;where are you going
2278;207;Kratos;Male;we are done
2279;207;Freya;Female;you can't run away from this Kratos Odin won't stop until we stop him we need you here
2280;208;Atreus;Male;father can we I want to go hunting
2281;208;Kratos;Male;I will follow
2282;208;Mimir;Male;we are with you Atreus
2283;208;Kratos;Male;what do we hunt?
2284;208;Atreus;Male;deer
2285;208;Mimir;Male;which way we headed lad
2286;208;Atreus;Male;in the direction of deer
2287;209;Atreus;Male;elbow up accuracy over speed why now it's running
2288;209;Kratos;Male;and so are we
2289;209;Atreus;Male;I don't understand
2290;209;Kratos;Male;when an animal is wounded it must stop the bleeding or it will die we have been wounded and this this is a distraction
2291;209;Atreus;Male;it's my fault
2292;209;Kratos;Male;no no
2293;209;Atreus;Male;we should find Sindri I have a pretty good idea where he might be
2294;209;Kratos;Male;lead
2295;210;Atreus;Male;Sindri Sindri I'm so sorry
2296;210;Sindri;Male;no no I don't want to hear it you don't know what sorry means
2297;210;Atreus;Male;we're not letting Odin get away with this
2298;210;Sindri;Male;would that be the Odin you invited into my home
2299;210;Kratos;Male;we were all fooled
2300;210;Sindri;Male;oh but some of us were bigger fools than others aren't we I gave you everything my skills my friendship my home my secrets my treasures and you just kept taking and now what have I got not even my family you want sorry this is what sorry looks like
2301;210;Atreus;Male;I what can we do we
2302;210;Sindri;Male;We there is no we there's only you no matter what the cost so what you can do is get the fuck out of my sight
2303;210;Kratos;Male;come Atreus leave him be mourn how you wish
2304;210;Atreus;Male;I I thought we were his family too
2305;210;Kratos;Male;we were
2306;211;Atreus;Male;are we even sure Freya will still be at the house
2307;211;Mimir;Male;don't see why not Odin's back door in was also his way out without the blasted raven apparently hiding in the broom closet the house should be secure
2308;211;Kratos;Male;and she will not turn away allies in her vengeance
2309;211;Mimir;Male;Aye it's all our vengeance now and no more fake Tyr to twist our minds around oh what a mockery he made of tyr's desire for peace and mine
2310;212;Freya;Female;you're back are you with us
2311;212;Kratos;Male;hmmm
2312;212;Freya;Female;good it's time
2313;212;Mimir;Male;time for what dare I ask
2314;212;Freya;Female;time to unite the Realms against Odin once and for all
2315;212;Atreus;Male;Tyr tried to unite the Realms the real Tyr everyone loved him and even he failed
2316;212;Freya;Female;then we better not fail or there will be no one left to try this is Ragnarok
2317;212;Mimir;Male;and Odin's already heard every blasted plan we have
2318;212;Freya;Female;yes we've lost the element of surprise more than that we have only one way to Asgard and it's not simple
2319;212;Kratos;Male;Gjallarhorn
2320;212;Freya;Female;it means we enter from Tyr's temple here Asgard's wall is here Odin's host of Einherjar will hold the space in between
2321;212;Freyr;Male;which means we need armies of our own
2322;212;Freya;Female;as many as we'll answer the call numbers Odin won't see coming
2323;212;Mimir;Male;and that's just to reach the wall to breach the wall we'll need to find Surtr
2324;212;Freya;Female;Ratatoskr was able to procure this
2325;212;Kratos;Male;the three of us will go
2326;212;Atreus;Male;I know just where to look
2327;212;Mimir;Male;splendid allies then who do we think we can get
2328;212;Hildisvini;Male;I'll venture to Helheim try to recruit the army of the dead
2329;212;Freyr;Male;and I'll return to Alfheim to unite the Elves
2330;212;Mimir;Male;just like that unite the Elves after centuries of War
2331;212;Freyr;Male;well they really like me in Alfheim
2332;212;Kratos;Male;and you to Vanaheim?
2333;212;Freya;Female;yes to find Sigrun and muster the free Valkyries
2334;212;Kratos;Male;Midgard has no army
2335;212;Mimir;Male;nor Niflheim nor Jotunheim
2336;212;Freya;Female;that leaves only Svartalfheim
2337;212;Sindri;Male;I'll go to Svartalfheim
2338;212;Atreus;Male;Sindri are you sure
2339;212;Sindri;Male;I said I'll go
2340;212;Freya;Female;so be it good luck to us all
2341;213;Kratos;Male;you said you know where to look for Surtr?
2342;213;Atreus;Male;yeah I unlocked the secrets in his shrine when I was in Muspelheim with Thor
2343;213;Kratos;Male;Thor
2344;213;Atreus;Male;don't worry he didn't see me go in
2345;213;Kratos;Male;that was not my worry
2346;213;Atreus;Male;now look when we find Surtr we'll have to convince him to combine with his wife Sinmara
2347;213;Kratos;Male;combine
2348;213;Atreus;Male;yeah when the two of them uh join they'll create an enormous Asgard destroying monster
2349;213;Mimir;Male;oh my
2350;214;Hildisvini;Male;Friends I am sorry to report negotiations are not going well in Helheim however there's a chance Hraesvelgr might be more amenable if speaking to a member of the uh deceased Mimir you're needed
2351;214;Mimir;Male;Oh death is a skill now I suppose these two can survive a bit without me brother if you wouldn't mind
2352;214;Kratos;Male;very well
2353;214;Hildisvini;Male;many thanks we'll catch up with you later
2354;215;Atreus;Male;hello
2355;215;Kratos;Male;we seek a fire Giant
2356;215;Surtr;Male;go away
2357;215;Atreus;Male;what just happened
2358;215;Surtr;Male;I won't help you
2359;215;Kratos;Male;who are you
2360;215;Surtr;Male;who you seek what's left of him
2361;215;Atreus;Male;why won't you help us
2362;215;Surtr;Male;I don't want to
2363;215;Kratos;Male;elaborate
2364;215;Surtr;Male;we will die
2365;215;Atreus;Male;right because you've got so much to live for
2366;215;Surtr;Male;not me her
2367;215;Atreus;Male;so what's the point of all this you keep separate from Sinmara just so you can sit here and wait to die at least if you joined with her you'd be together again
2368;215;Surtr;Male;we are together got her heart she's got mine it's not much but it's enough
2369;215;Atreus;Male;but you're not even
2370;215;Surtr;Male;have you ever been in love it's pretty good
2371;215;Kratos;Male;then Odin will succeed and all realms save Asgard will fall
2372;215;Surtr;Male;yeah he must die it's true but I won't sacrifice her any more than you would him sorry
2373;215;Kratos;Male;come
2374;215;Surtr;Male;wait those blades may I see them hmmm yeah there is primordial fire in those
2375;215;Kratos;Male;they are not of these lands
2376;215;Surtr;Male;shouldn't matter yeah that could work
2377;215;Atreus;Male;What could
2378;215;Surtr;Male;put those in here and I'll become your monster but I don't want her involved at all
2379;215;Atreus;Male;but the prophecy says you two have to combine sure this will work
2380;215;Surtr;Male;what have I got to live for not here follow me
2381;215;Kratos;Male;where do we go
2382;215;Surtr;Male;spark of the world
2383;216;Surtr;Male;choosing the lesser pain
2384;216;Atreus;Male;that doesn't make any sense
2385;216;Surtr;Male;promise you'll stay away from her
2386;216;Kratos;Male;you have our word
2387;216;Atreus;Male;Surtr is stabbing you with the blades gonna be enough to create this new you
2388;216;Surtr;Male;Sinmara's heart is cold so beautifully cold your dad's now got my fire in those blades if enough of me and the Spark's fire go into enough of her it should work
2389;216;Atreus;Male;Okay
2390;216;Surtr;Male;come here Blades move this will hurt now I'm a really painful part My fire her heart combine them you get Ragnarok it's time
2391;216;Atreus;Male;how long do you think this is gonna take
2392;216;Kratos;Male;Valkyries

2413;220;Freya;Female;better than that they are reborn corporeal and uncorrupted thanks to no small amount of Vanir magic they're Shield maidens now
2414;220;Atreus;Male;nice
2415;220;Kratos;Male;and your brother?
2416;220;Freya;Female;he came through the Elves called a truce to unite against Asgard that gives us an advantage by air and with Hel's army for a vanguard
2417;220;Atreus;Male;what about Sindri will the dwarves fight
2418;220;Freya;Female;we haven't heard from him but there's time yet and I think we have what we need to clear a path for the Ragnarok Beast
2419;220;Mimir;Male;well when you say it like that why worry at all Sigrun it's good to see you so alive
2420;220;Sigrun;Male;oh yes I wasn't myself when last we met I'm glad you're safe my queen The Shield maidens will be divided among the forces breaching from Alfheim Helheim and here in Midgard we stand ready Kratos Atreus Mimir please excuse me

2422;220;Kratos;Male;Freya have you determined our path out of Asgard
2423;220;Freya;Female;if the towers are the way in we count on them being the way out
2424;220;Kratos;Male;and if they are not
2425;220;Freya;Female;then we all know what we signed up for our plan is only missing one thing a leader
2426;220;Kratos;Male;that honor is yours you have a righteous claim and the respect of your troops and you have faced this enemy before
2427;220;Freya;Female;I held his invading army to a stalemate this is our invasion a siege on his terrain I want our most experienced wartime general in the field I don't care about the honors I don't care about the prophecies and champions I just need us to win
2428;220;Kratos;Male;Freya

2437;221;Sigrun;Male;you only tell silly stories Mimir
2438;221;Mimir;Male;I could never argue with you

2443;222;Atreus;Male;if I fall asleep promise you'll finish it tomorrow
2444;222;Kratos;Male;of course now close your eyes there was an old man who chopped wood for his village every evening he bore the logs on his back and delivered them to his people but the logs were heavy and he grew weaker as time went and one day he threw down the logs as he could no longer bear their weight and he called for Death to come to him and when Death arrived he
2445;223;Brok;Male;Faye's the only one whi ever got my highbrow sense of humor damn fine woman she was apart from her taste in men of course
2446;223;Sindri;Male;she was a special woman she wanted to protect people
2447;223;Atreus;Male;she was here she saw every step we took before we took it like she was always with us watching over us you leading us home
2448;223;Faye;Female;does my request upset you Death is a natural part of life my love I wish only to be prepared for when my time comes we mortals must do such things I am glad to have you prepare with me
2449;224;Faye;Female;you are quiet
2450;224;Kratos;Male;I have nothing to say
2451;224;Faye;Female;well say something I enjoy hearing your voice
2452;224;Kratos;Male;a funeral pyre I would have chosen different
2453;224;Faye;Female;oh
2454;224;Kratos;Male;in my land we entomb our loved ones
2455;224;Faye;Female;you would have me trapped in the ground for eternity
2456;224;Kratos;Male;I would have you close to me
2457;224;Faye;Female;how touching my rotting corpse would bring you such comfort
2458;225;Faye;Female;you once tried to take charge of your ending did you not
2459;225;Kratos;Male;that was different
2460;225;Faye;Female;in circumstance yes but not in purpose
2461;225;Kratos;Male;you prepare for a distant future there is much time ahead of us
2462;225;Faye;Female;I wish to better a future that will exist without me whenever that day comes for you and for our son we will always walk together Kratos you will always be a part of me I will always be a part of you
2463;225;Kratos;Male;and when you were gone that a part of me dies as well Faye to feel your absence
2464;225;Faye;Female;the culmination of love is grief and yet we love despite the inevitable we open our hearts to it when the pyre is spent and you have gathered my ashes spread them from the highest peak in all the realms you will do this for me to grieve deeply is to have loved fully open your heart to the world as you have opened it to me and you will find every reason to keep living in it
2465;226;Atreus;Male;what's going on
2466;226;Kratos;Male;it is time
2467;226;Atreus;Male;I'll meet you outside father sir
2468;226;Sigrun;Male;we'd hoped to fly into battle with you one more time my queen

2470;226;Kratos;Male;yes I will be your general

2472;226;Mimir;Male;Aye brother I'll be right by your side so what are your orders
2473;226;Kratos;Male;to the temple
2474;227;Freya;Female;General

2476;227;Sigrun;Male;General
2477;227;Hildisvini;Male;General
2478;227;Eir;Female;Sir
2479;227;Freyr;Male;hey bud uh General
2480;227;Kratos;Male;I came to these lands to escape my past to start a new life I can hide no longer I do not want this war we have suffered enough prophecy did not lead us here nor will it win this battle Wars are won by those that are willing to sacrifice everything if that is the cost of vengeance so be it
2481;227;Freya;Female;Odin has taken so much from us already the Realms have suffered enough no matter the cost this ends today
2482;227;Freyr;Male;If going out in blaze of glory means that Odin burns too Then that's where I'll be with a big fat smile on my face
2483;227;Atreus;Male;for Brok
2484;227;Kratos;Male;Ready yourselves
2485;228;Freyr;Male;Yeah Yeah hahahaha wooo
2486;228;Kratos;Male;the Muspelheim Tower has fallen
2487;228;Atreus;Male;and if Odin goes after Niflheim next
2488;228;Freyr;Male;they're trying to shut out Ragnarok
2489;228;Atreus;Male;we got to stop those war machines
2490;228;Mimir;Male;not an ideal start
2491;228;Freyr;Male;wait
2492;228;Freya;Female;Yngvi we don't have time
2493;228;Freyr;Male;I know just wait
2494;228;Atreus;Male;Ingrid
2495;228;Freyr;Male;well we got work to do
2496;228;Kratos;Male;you three follow Atreus Freya with me watch our flanks to the war machines
2497;229;Atreus;Male;looks like the giant giants made it after all
2498;229;Kratos;Male;the snake looks different
2499;229;Atreus;Male;he is different but when I was away uh uh never mind later
2500;229;Freya;Female;the Einherjar's link to Valhalla my sisters and I must sever It
2501;229;Kratos;Male;Go
2502;229;Hildisvini;Male;still no sign of the dwarves
2503;229;Atreus;Male;Sindri won't let us down we have to trust him
2504;229;Kratos;Male;rally all you can we will make for Svartalfheim Tower
2505;230;Mimir;Male;About bloody time he showed up
2506;230;Atreus;Male;now what
2507;230;Sindri;Male;you don't get to use us anymore more or less what you wanted
2508;230;Atreus;Male;I didn't want this no close your heart to it close your heart
2509;231;Kratos;Male;who are they
2510;231;Atreus;Male;Midgardians Odin took them in they shouldn't be here they're not soldiers
2511;231;Kratos;Male;Odin put them in our path to die
2512;231;Atreus;Male;it's war wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything what are you doing
2513;231;Kratos;Male;son listen closely you feel their pain because that is who you are and you must never sacrifice that never not for anyone I was wrong Atreus I was wrong open your heart open your heart to their suffering that is your mother's wish and mine as well today son today we will be better
2514;231;Atreus;Male;but what can we do
2515;232;Freyr;Male;see the size of that thing I think we're gonna win I mean if they don't give us first
2516;232;Freya;Female;why have you stopped Ragnarok is here we finally have Odin right where
2517;232;Kratos;Male;we will stop Odin but we did not come to sacrifice the innocent we will breach the wall and Hrimthur's Flaw
2518;232;Freya;Female;with what army
2519;232;Kratos;Male;Atreus and I will be enough
2520;232;Freya;Female;That is suicide
2521;232;Kratos;Male;it may be but we will die seeking justice not vengeance can that weapon break open the flaw
2522;232;Sindri;Male;only one way to find out
2523;232;Kratos;Male;you three get those people to safety wherever you can find it
2524;232;Hildisvini;Male;we will see it done
2525;232;Freyr;Male;Freya and I will do what we can to slow Ragnarok
2526;232;Kratos;Male;He was not mindless before see if he listen to reason Odin will not get away
2527;232;Freya;Female;if he does so help me
2528;232;Kratos;Male;I know no no protect him I will help those who are trapped and meet you at the flaw go go Atreus
2529;232;Atreus;Male;Sindri can't let it control me
2530;233;Thrud;Female;you really had me believing you that we didn't have to be enemies
2531;233;Atreus;Male;Thrud you're okay
2532;233;Thrud;Female;but mom was right about you all along you're a killer just like your father and you're here to kill us all
2533;233;Atreus;Male;no just Odin Sindri don't she's a friend
2534;233;Thrud;Female;friends don't bring the end of the world to each other's doorstep Loki
2535;233;Atreus;Male;you're right you're right I I made some bad decisions
2536;233;Thrud;Female;you do that a lot I'm not sure that's a defense
2537;233;Atreus;Male;it's not a defense I just want to make it right is Skjoldr okay have you seen him
2538;233;Thrud;Female;why wouldn't he be what are you talking about
2539;233;Atreus;Male;Odin is willing to sacrifice the Midgardians he put them along the wall to try and deter us knowing they can't fight their deaths are just meant to slow us down
2540;233;Thrud;Female;why would he do that and how am I supposed to believe you
2541;233;Sif;Female;because he's right it's who Odin is it's who he's always been
2542;233;Thrud;Female;mom why are you here what
2543;233;Sif;Female;he'll sacrifice anyone at a problem with him the Midgardians your friend our family any of us I'd hope that your father would stand up to him but now it has to be you
2544;233;Thrud;Female;Mom what are you saying
2545;233;Sif;Female;Thrud I never doubted that you would make the finest Valkyrie these Realms have ever seen but not for him do you understand
2546;233;Thrud;Female;but our family
2547;233;Sif;Female;without Odin we can be one again a real one what he's doing is wrong
2548;233;Skjoldr;Male;he said if we held our ground we'd be safe and he said we owed him
2549;233;Atreus;Male;you don't owe him your death
2550;233;Skjoldr;Male;no shit
2551;233;Thrud;Female;dad will never let them get to grandfather
2552;233;Sif;Female;then go with him he'll listen to you are you ready to go find the rest of your people
